Of course, these transceivers have a limited range so if two are too far apart, they cannot communicate directly.\n\n\nThe Chef invested in top-of-the-line transceivers which have a few advanced features. One is that even if two people cannot talk directly because they are out of range, if there is another transceiver that is close enough to both, then the two transceivers can still communicate with each other using the third transceiver as an intermediate device.\n\n\nThere has been a minor emergency in the Chef's restaurant\nand he needs to communicate with both the head server and the sous-chef right away. Help the Chef determine if it is possible for all three people to communicate with each other, even if two must communicate through the third because they are too far apart.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single positive integer T \u2264 100 indicating the number of test cases to follow. The first line of each test case contains a positive integer R \u2264 1,000 indicating that two transceivers can communicate directly without an intermediate transceiver if they are at most R meters away from each other. The remaining three lines of the test case describe the current locations of the Chef, the head server, and the sous-chef, respectively. Each such line contains two integers X,Y (at most 10,000 in absolute value) indicating that the respective person is located at position X,Y.\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case you are to output a single line containing a single string. If it is possible for all three to communicate then you should output \"yes\". Otherwise, you should output \"no\".\n\n\nTo be clear, we say that two transceivers are close enough to communicate directly if the length of the straight line connecting their X,Y coordinates is at most R.\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n3\n1\n0 1\n0 0\n1 0\n2\n0 1\n0 0\n1 0\n2\n0 0\n0 2\n2 1\n\n\nOutput:\nyes\nyes\nno\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

For example, the string S = 7477447 is balanced since S[1, 4] = 7477 has 1 digit 4 and S[5, 7] = 447 has 1 digit 7. On the other hand, one can verify that the string S = 7 is not balanced.\n The Little Elephant has the string S of the length N.

        "prompt": "### Prompt\nRecently Johnny have learned bogosort sorting algorithm. He thought that it is too ineffective. So he decided to improve it. As you may know this algorithm shuffles the sequence randomly until it is sorted. Johnny decided that we don't need to shuffle the whole sequence every time. If after the last shuffle several first elements end up in the right places we will fix them and don't shuffle those elements furthermore. We will do the same for the last elements if they are in the right places. For example, if the initial sequence is (3, 5, 1, 6, 4, 2) and after one shuffle Johnny gets (1, 2, 5, 4, 3, 6) he will fix 1, 2 and 6 and proceed with sorting (5, 4, 3) using the same algorithm. Johnny hopes that this optimization will significantly improve the algorithm. Help him calculate the expected amount of shuffles for the improved algorithm to sort the sequence of the first n natural numbers given that no elements are in the right places initially.\n\nInput\nThe first line of input file is number t - the number of test cases.

        "prompt": "### Prompt\nChef had a hard time arguing with his friend, and after getting a great old kick Chef saw a colored array with N cells, numbered from 1 to N. \nThe kick was so strong that Chef suddenly understood the rules of the game. \n\nEach cell is painted with a color. Here the colors are numbered from 1 to M.\nFor any cell i, Chef can repaint it with any color q, and the cost of such operation is Ci,q points.\nHowever Chef can do at most K repaintings (0 repaintings is possible). \nAfter performing all repaintings, each cell will have some color. For each cell i, if cell i has color q then Chef will receive Bi,q points.\n\nNow Chef is wondering how many points can he receive in total when he repaints optimally.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, M and K, denoting the number of cells and the number of colors, the maximal possible number of repaintings respectively. The next line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN, denoting the initial colors of the cells. Then N lines follow. The i^th line of them contains M integers Bi1, Bi2, ..., BiM, where Bij denotes how many points Chef will receive if the cell i will be painted with j-th color after all operations. Then N lines follow. The i^th line  of them contains M integers Ci1, Ci2, ..., CiM, where Cij denotes how many points Chef will lose if he repaints the cell i with color j.\n\nNote: Be careful that the size of input files can be large.\n\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the maximal possible points.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 5\n0 \u2264 K \u2264 1000\n1 \u2264 N, M \u2264 1000\n1 \u2264 Ai \u2264 M\n0 \u2264 Bi,j \u2264 1000\n0 \u2264 Ci,j \u2264 1000\nIf j = Ai, then Ci,j = 0\n\n\nExample\nInput:\n1\n4 2 1\n1 1 2 2\n1 1\n1 1\n1 1\n3 1\n0 1\n0 1\n1 0\n1 0\n\nOutput:\n5\n\nExplanation:\n For this sample, we can repaint only once, since K = 1. We should repaint 4^th cell with color 1. We will pay 1 for this, and receive: \n1 (1^st cell - 1^st color) + \n1 (2^nd cell -1^st color) + \n1 (3^rd cell - 2^nd color) + \n3 (4^th cell - 1^st color)  = 6.\nHence we get 6 \u2212 1 = 5 points in total, and it is the optimal answer.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

During his move the player chooses a pair and decreases the larger integer in the pair by a positive multiple of the smaller integer in the pair in such a way that both integers in the pair remain positive. If two numbers in some pair become equal then the pair is removed from the sequence. The player who can not make any move loses (or in another words the player who encounters an empty sequence loses). Given the sequence of positive integer pairs determine whether the first player can win or not (assuming that both players are playing optimally).\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nEach test starts with an integer N denoting the number of pairs. Each of the next N lines contains a pair of positive integers. \n\u00a0\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing \"YES\" if the first player can win and \"NO\" otherwise. \n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 100\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 100\nAll other integers are between 1 to 10^8\nThe integers in each pair will be different\n\n\u00a0\n\nExample\nInput:\n3\n1\n2 3\n2\n4 5\n5 6\n2\n2 3\n3 5\n\nOutput:\nNO\nNO\nYES\n\n\u00a0\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1. The first player don't have any choice other subtracting 2 from 3. So during the turn of the second player integer pair will be (2,1). The second player will win by subtracting 1 from 2. \nExample case 2. If the first player choose to move (4,5) to (4,1) the second player will make it to (1,1). If the first player choose to move (5,6) to (5,1) the second player will make it to (1,1). So regardless of the move of the first player, the second will always win.\nExample case 3. The first player will select pair (3,5) and make it to (3,2). Now both pairs are equal. So whatever the move of second player he will just mirror that move in another pair. This will ensure his win.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",
