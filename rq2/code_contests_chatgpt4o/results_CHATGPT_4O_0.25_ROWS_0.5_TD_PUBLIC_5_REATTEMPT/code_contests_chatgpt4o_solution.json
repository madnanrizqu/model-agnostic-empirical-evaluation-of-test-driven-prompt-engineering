Of course, these transceivers have a limited range so if two are too far apart, they cannot communicate directly.\n\n\nThe Chef invested in top-of-the-line transceivers which have a few advanced features. One is that even if two people cannot talk directly because they are out of range, if there is another transceiver that is close enough to both, then the two transceivers can still communicate with each other using the third transceiver as an intermediate device.\n\n\nThere has been a minor emergency in the Chef's restaurant\nand he needs to communicate with both the head server and the sous-chef right away. Help the Chef determine if it is possible for all three people to communicate with each other, even if two must communicate through the third because they are too far apart.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single positive integer T \u2264 100 indicating the number of test cases to follow. The first line of each test case contains a positive integer R \u2264 1,000 indicating that two transceivers can communicate directly without an intermediate transceiver if they are at most R meters away from each other. The remaining three lines of the test case describe the current locations of the Chef, the head server, and the sous-chef, respectively. Each such line contains two integers X,Y (at most 10,000 in absolute value) indicating that the respective person is located at position X,Y.\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case you are to output a single line containing a single string. If it is possible for all three to communicate then you should output \"yes\". Otherwise, you should output \"no\".\n\n\nTo be clear, we say that two transceivers are close enough to communicate directly if the length of the straight line connecting their X,Y coordinates is at most R.\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n3\n1\n0 1\n0 0\n1 0\n2\n0 1\n0 0\n1 0\n2\n0 0\n0 2\n2 1\n\n\nOutput:\nyes\nyes\nno\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

For example, the string S = 7477447 is balanced since S[1, 4] = 7477 has 1 digit 4 and S[5, 7] = 447 has 1 digit 7. On the other hand, one can verify that the string S = 7 is not balanced.\n The Little Elephant has the string S of the length N. He wants to know the number of such pairs of integers (L; R) that 1 \u2264 L \u2264 R \u2264 N and the substring S[L, R]  is balanced. Help him to find this number.\nNotes.\n\nLet S be some lucky string. Then\n\n\n|S| denotes the length of the string S;\n\nS[i] (1 \u2264 i \u2264 |S|) denotes the i^th character of S (the numeration of characters starts from 1);\n\n S[L, R] (1 \u2264 L \u2264 R \u2264 |S|) denotes the string with the following sequence of characters: S[L], S[L + 1], ..., S[R], and is called a substring of S. For L > R we mean by S[L, R] an empty string.\n\n\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input file contains a single integer T, the number of test cases.

As you may know this algorithm shuffles the sequence randomly until it is sorted. Johnny decided that we don't need to shuffle the whole sequence every time. If after the last shuffle several first elements end up in the right places we will fix them and don't shuffle those elements furthermore. We will do the same for the last elements if they are in the right places. For example, if the initial sequence is (3, 5, 1, 6, 4, 2) and after one shuffle Johnny gets (1, 2, 5, 4, 3, 6) he will fix 1, 2 and 6 and proceed with sorting (5, 4, 3) using the same algorithm.

You can read the page once before attempting the problem if you wish, nonetheless we will be providing all the information needed here itself.\n\n\nLaddu Accrual System is our new goodie distribution program. In this program, we will be distributing Laddus in place of goodies for your winnings and various other activities (described below), that you perform on our system. Once you collect enough number of Laddus, you can then redeem them to get yourself anything from a wide range of CodeChef goodies.\n\n\nLet us know about various activities and amount of laddus you get corresponding to them.\n\nContest Win (CodeChef\u2019s Long, Cook-Off, LTIME, or any contest hosted with us) : 300 + Bonus (Bonus = 20 - contest rank). Note that if your rank is > 20, then you won't get any bonus.\nTop Contributor on Discuss : 300\nBug Finder\t: 50 - 1000 (depending on the bug severity). It may also fetch you a CodeChef internship! \nContest Hosting\t : 50 \n\n\nYou can do a checkout for redeeming laddus once a month. The minimum laddus redeemable at Check Out are 200 for Indians and 400 for the rest of the world.\n\n\nYou are given history of various activities of a user. The user has not redeemed any of the its laddus accrued.. Now the user just wants to redeem as less amount of laddus he/she can, so that the laddus can last for as long as possible. Find out for how many maximum number of months he can redeem the laddus.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer T denoting number of test cases\nFor each test case:\n\nFirst line contains an integer followed by a string denoting activities, origin respectively, where activities denotes number of activities of the user, origin denotes whether the user is Indian or the rest of the world. origin can be \"INDIAN\" or \"NON_INDIAN\".\nFor each of the next activities lines, each line contains an activity. \n\t\t\tAn activity can be of four types as defined above. \n\nContest Win : Input will be of form of CONTEST_WON rank, where rank denotes the rank of the user. \nTop Contributor : Input will be of form of TOP_CONTRIBUTOR.\nBug Finder : Input will be of form of BUG_FOUND severity, where severity denotes the severity of the bug. \nContest Hosting : Input will be of form of CONTEST_HOSTED.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, find out the maximum number of months for which the user can redeem the laddus accrued.\n\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T, activities \u2264 100\n1 \u2264 rank \u2264 5000\n50 \u2264 severity \u2264 1000\n\n\nExample\nInput:\n2\n4 INDIAN\nCONTEST_WON 1\nTOP_CONTRIBUTOR\nBUG_FOUND 100\nCONTEST_HOSTED\n4 NON_INDIAN\nCONTEST_WON 1\nTOP_CONTRIBUTOR\nBUG_FOUND 100\nCONTEST_HOSTED\n\nOutput:\n3\n1\n\nExplanation\nIn the first example, \n\nFor winning contest with rank 1, user gets 300 + 20 - 1 = 319 laddus. \nFor top contributor, user gets 300 laddus. \nFor finding a bug with severity of 100, user gets 100 laddus. \nFor hosting a contest, user gets 50 laddus. \n\n\nSo, overall user gets 319 + 300 + 100 + 50 = 769 laddus.\nNow, the user is an Indian user, he can redeem only 200 laddus per month. So, for first three months, he will redeem 200 * 3 = 600 laddus. The remaining 169 laddus, he can not redeem as he requires at least 200 laddues in a month to redeem. \nSo, answer is 3.\n\nIn the second example, user is a non-Indian user, he can redeem 400 laddues per month. So, in the first month, he will redeem 400 laddus. The remaining 369 laddus, he can not redeem as he requires at least 400 laddues in a month to redeem. \nSo, answer is 1.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

        "prompt": "### Prompt\nThe much anticipated video game \"BiCo Grid\" has been released. The rules of \"Bico Grid\" are very simple.\nThe game field is a 100x100 matrix, where each cell is either a blocked cell, or a cell with some number of coins. For a regular player the look of the field seems pretty random, but the programmer in you recognizes the following pattern: the i-th cell on the n-th row contains C(n, i) coins if and only if 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n, all other cells are blocked. Record C(n, i) denotes binomial coefficient \"n choose i\".\nThe player starts from the cell situated at row R and column C in the matrix. The objective is to collect exactly G number of coins from matrix in several moves. There are some rules: \n\nOn each move the player must collect all the coins from some unblocked cell in the current column.\nThe rules of the game state, that player mustn't be really greedy, so the number of coins he collected must not increase. In other words, if at some move the player collected X coins then further he cannot collect more than X coins in a single move.\nAfter each move, the player is immediately moved to some cell of the column W-1 (where W denotes the current column of the player). If the current column of the player has index 0, the game ends.\nThe game ends when player collects exactly G number of coins.\n\nYou are given the description of the game. Please, output the sequence of moves that win the game (collect exactly G coins)! It is guaranteed that if the player will play optimally it is possible to win the game.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T lines follows. Each containing three integers, R denoting the starting row, C, denoting the starting column, and G, denoting the number of coins to be collected.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output two lines. First line contains K, the number of column visited before completion of game. Second line contains K space separated integers, the number of coins collected from the cells, in the order they were collected.\nIt is guaranteed that a solution exists.

        "prompt": "### Prompt\nChef likes to travel very much. He plans some travel routes and wants to know their lengths. He hired you to make these calculations. But be careful, some of the routes are incorrect. There may be some misspelling in city names or there will be no road between some two consecutive cities in the route. Also note that Chef hates to visit the same city twice during his travel. Even the last city should differ from the first. Two consecutive cities in the route should also be different. So you need to check these conditions for the given routes too.\n\nYou will be given the list of all cities and all roads between them with their lengths. All roads are one-way. Also you will be given the list of all travel routes that Chef plans. For each route you should check whether it is correct and find its length in this case.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains positive integer N, the number of cities. The second line contains space separated list of N strings, city names. All city names are distinct.\n\nThe third line contains non-negative integer M, the number of available roads. Each of the next M lines describes one road and contains names C1 and C2 of two cities followed by the positive integer D, the length of the one-way road that connects C1 with C2. It is guaranteed that C1 and C2 will be correct names of two different cities from the list of N cities given in the second line of the input file. For each pair of different cities there is at most one road in each direction and each road will be described exactly once in the input file.\n\nNext line contains positive integer T, the number of travel routes planned by the Chef. Each of the next T lines contains positive integer K followed by K strings, names of cities of the current route. Cities are given in order in which Chef will visit them during his travel.\n\nAll strings in the input file composed only of lowercase, uppercase letters of the English alphabet and hyphens. Each string is non-empty and has length at most 20. If some line of the input file contains more then one element than consecutive elements of this line are separated by exactly one space. Each line of the input file has no leading or trailing spaces.\n\n\nOutput\n For each travel route from the input file output a single line containing word ERROR if the route is incorrect and its length otherwise.\n\n\nConstraints\n\n1 <= N <= 50\n\n0 <= M <= N * (N - 1)\n\n1 <= D <= 20000\n\n1 <= T <= 50\n\n1 <= K <= 50\n\n1 <= length of each string <= 20\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n5\nDonetsk Kiev New-York Miami Hollywood\n9\nDonetsk Kiev 560\nKiev New-York 7507\nNew-York Miami 1764\nMiami Hollywood 28\nHollywood Miami 30\nMiami New-York 1764\nKiev Donetsk 550\nHollywood New-York 1736\nNew-York Hollywood 1738\n13\n5 Donetsk Kiev New-York Miami Hollywood\n5 Hollywood Miami New-York Kiev Donetsk\n3 Donetsk Kiev Donetsk\n2 Kyiv New-York\n3 New-York Hollywood Miami\n2 New-York Miami\n3 Hollywood New-York Miami\n4 Donetsk Kiev Miami Hollywood\n2 Donetsk Hollywood\n1 Donetsk\n2 Mumbai Deli\n6 Donetsk Kiev New-York Miami Hollywood New-York\n2 Miami Miami\n\nOutput:\n9859\nERROR\nERROR\nERROR\n1768\n1764\n3500\nERROR\nERROR\n0\nERROR\nERROR\nERROR\n\n\nExplanation\nThe 2^nd route is incorrect since there is no road from New-York to Kiev. Note however that inverse road from Kiev to New-York exists. \nThe 3^rd route is incorrect since the first city coincides with the last one. \nThe 4^th route is incorrect since there is no city with name Kyiv (Probably Chef means Kiev but he misspells this word). \nThe 8^th route is incorrect since there is no road from Miami to Kiev. \nThe 9^th route is incorrect since there is no road from Donetsk to  Hollywood. \nThe 10^th route is correct. Note that a route composed of exactly one city is always correct provided that city name is written correctly. \nThe 11^th route is incorrect since there is no cities with names Mumbai and Deli. (Probably Chef is not so good in geography :)) \nThe 12^th route is incorrect since city New-York is visited twice. \nFinally the 13^th route is incorrect since we have equal consecutive cities.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

In fact, I can tell you with the utmost certainty that in the last game you lied to me at least *** times.\n\n\n\nSo, how many times at least did Johnny lie to Alice?

He went to watch this year's Indian Grand Prix at New Delhi. He noticed that one segment of the circuit was a long straight road. It was impossible for a car to overtake other cars on this segment. Therefore, a car had to lower down its speed if there was a slower car in front of it. While watching the race, Chef started to wonder how many cars were moving at their maximum speed.\nFormally, you're given the maximum speed of N cars in the order they entered the long straight segment of the circuit. Each car prefers to move at its maximum speed. If that's not possible because of the front car being slow, it might have to lower its speed. It still moves at the fastest possible speed while avoiding any collisions. For the purpose of this problem, you can assume that the straight segment is infinitely long.\nCount the number of cars which were moving at their maximum speed on the straight segment.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases to follow. Description of each test case contains 2 lines. The first of these lines contain a single integer N, the number of cars. The second line contains N space separated integers, denoting the maximum speed of the cars in the order they entered the long straight segment.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the number of cars which were moving at their maximum speed on the segment.\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n3\n1\n10\n3\n8 3 6\n5\n4 5 1 2 3\n\nOutput:\n1\n2\n2\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 100\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 10,000\nAll speeds are distinct positive integers that fit in a 32 bit signed integer.\nEach input file will not be larger than 4 MB (4,000,000,000 bytes) in size.\n\nWARNING!

The Galactik Football Assosiation (GFA) has announced a football tournament between all the teams of all the planets in the galaxy (say N). Teams like Snow Kids, Shadows, Xenons, Red Tigers, Wambas, Pirates, etc. are in total enthusiasm and are practising hard to win the cup using their talent and flux.\nEach planet of the galaxy has a government. Some governments have a mutual agreement between them. If planet A has mutual agreement with planet B, then there is a bidirectional spaceway between A and B using which anybody can go from A to B and vice-versa. People can use these spaceways to travel from one planet to another, if there exists a path between them using some of the spaceways.\nEach planet has it's own football ground. The GFA has planned the matches in such a way that a team can have a match at any of these grounds. The GFA has come across some problems in the execution of their plan. They have found out that there are many pairs of planets between which there does not exist any path, so the football team of one of those planets can't reach the other planet. They requested the corresponding governments to make a spaceway between them, but because of absense of mutual agreement (duhhh.. Politics!), these goverment did not agree. So the GFA suggested that they will make teleports between some pairs of planets which will be used only by the football teams to travel.\nBut there are two types of governments in the galaxy\n1. Some of the governments are greedy (duhhh..). They want to make money (You don't say!) throught the GFA. So each of these government has asked the GFA for a tax value which it has to pay if it wants to make a teleport ending at their planet.\n2. Others want to sponser the event, so they will give money to the GFA if they make a teleport ending at their planet (That's new..). The GFA would always avoid such governments no matter what the consequences are, because these kind of governments have always some dirty plans in their minds for the GFA.\nNow, the GFA wants to make bi-directional teleports between planets such that the football teams of any planet can reach any other planet to play a football match, using spaceways between the planets and/or teleports made by the GFA.\nThe GFA also has financial problems and want to spend as little money as possible. They have come to you so that you can help them calculate the minimum ammount of money needed to fulfill their plan.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input consists of two integers - N and M. N is number of planets and M is number of pairs of planets which have a mutual agreement, i.e they have a spaceway between them. Then, M lines follow, each containing two space separated integers A and B, denoting a mutual agreement and hence a spaceway to travel, between plenet A and planet B. Then, N lines follow. The i^th line has an integer C. If C \u2265 0, then it represents the tax value which the GFA has to pay to the government of planet i (it's a type 1 government). If C < 0, then it represents the money the ith government will pay to the GFA (it's a type 2 government).\n\nOutput\nPrint the minimum amount needed for the GFA to fulfill their plan if it can be fulfilled, else print \"-1\" (without quotes).\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 100,000\n0 \u2264 M \u2264 1,000,000\n0 \u2264 |C| \u2264 10,000\n1 \u2264 A,B \u2264 N\nA \u2260 B\n\nSample\n\nInput 1\n6 6\n1 2\n2 3\n1 3\n4 5\n5 6\n4 6\n1\n3\n5\n2\n4\n6\n\nOutput 1\n3\n\n\nInput 2\n3 1\n2 3\n1\n-1\n-1\n\nOutput 2\n-1\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

For example, strings \"47\", \"744\", \"4\" are lucky while \"5\", \"17\", \"467\" are not.\n\n\nThe Little Elephant has the strings A and B of digits. These strings are of equal lengths, that is |A| = |B|. He wants to get some lucky string from them. For this he performs the following operations. At first he arbitrary reorders digits of A. Then he arbitrary reorders digits of B. After that he creates the string C such that its i-th digit is the maximum between the i-th digit of A and the i-th digit of B. In other words, C[i] = max{A[i], B[i]} for i from 1 to |A|. After that he removes from C all non-lucky digits saving the order of the remaining (lucky) digits. So C now becomes a lucky string. For example, if after reordering A = \"754\" and B = \"873\", then C is at first \"874\" and then it becomes \"74\".\n\n\nThe Little Elephant wants the resulting string to be as lucky as possible. The formal definition of this is that the resulting string should be the lexicographically greatest possible string among all the strings that can be obtained from the given strings A and B by the described process.\n\nNotes\n\n|A| denotes the length of the string A.\nA[i] denotes the i-th digit of the string A. Here we numerate the digits starting from 1. So 1 \u2264 i \u2264 |A|.\nThe string A is called lexicographically greater than the string B if either there exists some index i such that A[i] > B[i] and for each j < i we have A[j] = B[j], or B is a proper prefix of A, that is, |A| > |B| and first |B| digits of A coincide with the corresponding digits of B.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains the string A. The second line contains the string B.\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case output a single line containing the answer for the corresponding test case. Note, that the answer can be an empty string. In this case you should print an empty line for the corresponding test case.\n\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 10000\n1 \u2264 |A| \u2264 20000\n|A| = |B|\nEach character of A and B is a digit.\nSum of |A| across all the tests in the input does not exceed 200000.\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n4\n4\n7\n435\n479\n7\n8\n1675475\n9756417\n\nOutput:\n7\n74\n\n777744\n\n\nExplanation\n\nCase 1. In this case the only possible string C we can get is \"7\" and it is the lucky string.\n\n\nCase 2. If we reorder A and B as A = \"543\" and B = \"749\" the string C will be at first \"749\" and then becomes \"74\". It can be shown that this is the lexicographically greatest string for the given A and B.\n\n\nCase 3. In this case the only possible string C we can get is \"8\" and it becomes and empty string after removing of non-lucky digits.\n\n\nCase 4. If we reorder A and B as A = \"7765541\" and B = \"5697714\" the string C will be at first \"7797744\" and then becomes \"777744\". Note that we can construct any lexicographically greater string for the given A and B since we have only four \"sevens\" and two \"fours\" among digits of both strings A and B as well the constructed string \"777744\".\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

Unfortunately, along the way, they suddenly find that some of the floorboards are missing, and that taking a step forward would have them plummet to their deaths below.\n\n\nDejected, but determined, they return to Polly's house, and decide to practice long-jumping in the yard before they re-attempt the crossing of the passage. It takes them exactly one day to master long-jumping a certain length. Also, once they have mastered jumping a particular length L, they are able to jump any amount less than equal to L as well.\n\n\nThe next day they return to their mission, but somehow find that there is another place further up the passage, that requires them to jump even more than they had practiced for. So they go back and repeat the process.\n\n\nNote the following:\n\n At each point, they are able to sense only how much they need to jump at that point, and have no idea of the further reaches of the passage till they reach there. That is, they are able to only see how far ahead is the next floorboard. \n The amount they choose to practice for their jump is exactly the amount they need to get across that particular part of the passage. That is, if they can currently jump upto a length L0, and they require to jump a length L1(> L0) at that point, they will practice jumping length L1 that day. \n They start by being able to \"jump\" a length of 1. \n\n\nFind how many days it will take them to cross the passageway. In the input, the passageway is described as a string P of '#'s and '.'s. A '#' represents a floorboard, while a '.' represents the absence of a floorboard. The string, when read from left to right, describes the passage from Polly's house to Digory's, and not vice-versa.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line consists of a single integer T, the number of testcases.\nEach of the next T lines consist of the string P for that case.\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each case, output the number of days it takes them to cross the passage.\n\n\nConstraints\n\n 1  \u2264 T  \u2264 1,000,000  (10^6)\n 1  \u2264 |P|  \u2264 1,000,000 (10^6)\n The total length of P will be \u2264 5,000,000 (5 * 10^6)across all test-cases of a test-file \n P will consist of only the characters # and . \n The first and the last characters of P will be #. \n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n4\n####\n##.#..#\n##..#.#\n##.#....#\n\nOutput:\n0\n2\n1\n2\n\nExplanation\n\nFor the first example, they do not need to learn any jump size. They are able to cross the entire passage by \"jumping\" lengths 1-1-1.\n\n\nFor the second example case, they get stuck at the first '.', and take one day learning to jump length 2. When they come back the next day, they get stuck at '..' and take one day to learn to jump length 3.\n\n\nFor the third example case, they get stuck first at '..', and they take one day to learn to jump length 3. On the second day, they are able to jump both length 3 as well as length 2 required to cross the passage.\n\n\nFor the last test case they need to stop and learn jumping two times. At first they need to jump a length 2 and then a length 5.\n\n\nAppendix\n\nIrrelevant to the problem description, if you're curious about what Uncle Andrew was up to, he was experimenting on Magic Rings that could facilitate travel between worlds. One such world, as some of you might have heard of, was Narnia.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

From any cell you can move to the cell below it or to the cell right to it. You should never go out of the grid.

If you have A dollars and B cents remaining in your purse after depositing the C cents, then after the transformation you will have B dollars and A cents. You can repeat this procedure as many times as you want unless you don't have enough money for the machine. If at any point C > B and A > 0, then the machine will allow you to break one of the A dollars into 100 cents so you can place C cents in the machine. The machine will not allow you to exchange a dollar for 100 cents if B >= C.\n \nOf course, you want to do this to maximize your profit. For example if C=69 and you have 9 dollars and 77 cents then after you put 69 cents in the machine you will have 8 dollars and 9 cents (9.77 --> 9.08 --> 8.09). But I should warn you that you can't cheat. If you try to throw away 9 cents before the transformation (in order to obtain 99 dollars and 8 cents after), the machine will sense you are cheating and take away all of your money. You need to know how many times you should do this transformation in order to make a maximum profit.

In this situation, variables are also known as unknowns and the values which satisfy the equality are known as solutions. An equation differs from an identity in that an equation is not necessarily true for all possible values of the variable.\nThere are many types of equations, and they are found in all areas of mathematics. For instance, a linear equation is an algebraic equation in which each term is either a constant or the product of a constant and (the first power of) a single variable.\nIn this problem we'll consider quite a special kind of systems of linear equations. To be more specific, you are given a system of N linear equations of the following form:\n\nx2 + x3 + ... + xN - 1 + xN = a1\nx1 + x3 + ... + xN - 1 + xN = a2\n...\nx1 + x2 + ... + xN - 2 + xN = aN - 1\nx1 + x2 + ... + xN - 2 + xN - 1 = aN\n\nIn other words, i'th equation of the system consists of the sum of all the variable x1, ..., xN except xi to the left of the equality sign and the constant ai to the right of the equality sign.\nOne can easily prove, that a system of linear equations as described above always have exactly one solution in case N is greater than one. Your task is to find the solution of the system(such a sequence x1, x2, ..., xN, that turns each of the equations into equality). It's guaranteed, that the solution of the system is a sequence consisting only of integers from the range [1, 10^8].\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.

Two employees that are not compatible cannot be paired together.\n\n\nFor each pair of compatible employees, the Chef has assigned a number estimating how well the overall quality of the food might increase.

The employees are numbered from 0 to n-1. The next m lines describe a pair of compatible employees, one per line. The i'th such line contains two distinct integers ui,vi between 0 and n-1. Strangely enough, the Chef estimates that picking the i'th pair ui,vi will increase the quality of food prepared in his kitchen by exactly 2^i.\n\n\nNo pair of employees will be given more than once in the input.

Chef knows four national Ukrainian dishes - salo, borsch, varenyky and galushky. It is too few, of course, but enough for the beginning. Every day in his restaurant will be a dish of the day among these four ones. And dishes of the consecutive days must be different. To make the scheme more refined the dish of the first day and the dish of the last day must be different too. Now he wants his assistant to make schedule for some period. Chef suspects that there is more than one possible schedule. Hence he wants his assistant to prepare all possible plans so that he can choose the best one among them. He asks you for help.

Vlad was the happiest man in the world! Now he can listen his favorite songs whenever he wants!\nVlad built up his own playlist. The playlist consists of N songs, each has a unique positive integer length. Vlad likes all the songs from his playlist, but there is a song, which he likes more than the others. It's named \"Uncle Johny\".\nAfter creation of the playlist, Vlad decided to sort the songs in increasing order of their lengths. For example, if the lengths of the songs in playlist was {1, 3, 5, 2, 4} after sorting it becomes {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Before the sorting, \"Uncle Johny\" was on K-th position (1-indexing is assumed for the playlist) in the playlist.\nVlad needs your help! He gives you all the information of his playlist. Your task is to find the position of \"Uncle Johny\" in  the sorted playlist.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. \nThe first line of each test case contains one integer N denoting the number of songs in Vlad's playlist.

The answer is 4, because {1, 2, 3, 9, 4} -> {1, 2, 3, 4, 9}. A5 now is on the 4-th position.\nTest case 3\nIn the third test case N equals to 5, K equals to 1, A equals to {1, 2, 3, 9, 4}.

Your task is to find a string T that appears in S as a subsequence exactly twice.\nIn other words, you need to find such a string T, that there exist exactly two sets of indexes i1, i2, ..., i|T| and j1, j2, ..., j|T| such that there exists some k, where  ik \u2260 jk and S{i1...i|T|} = S{j1...j|T|} = T.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first and only line of each test case contains a single string S.\nThe string S was generated randomly. For a generating string S, we first choose an integer N denoting a length of S. After that every symbol of the string S is chosen randomly from the set {\"A\", \"B\"} and the both symbols have equal probability to be chosen.\u00a0Note that N is not choosen randomly.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a string that occurs exactly twice as a subsequence in S, or output -1 if there is no such string.

Little Joe (uninvited) is curious to know how distant two people are, say X and Y.\nThere are 6 fundamental relations: father relation, mother relation, son relation, daughter relation, brother relation and sister relation. Using these fundamental relations we can describe all other relations between relatives. For example, one can say that Chef Prime is son of daughter of sister of father of father of Chef Composite.\nYou are given R relations of form \"A is F of B\", for N people from the party. There variable F is one of the following strings: father, mother, son, daughter, brother, sister. Also you are given Q queries of Little Joe, each query has form \"X Y\". For each query output the distance between persons X and Y. Distance is equal to the minimal number of fundamental relations appearing while describing the relation between X and Y. For example distance between Chef Prime and Chef Composite is 5. \nImportant points:\n1. Here brother (or sister) relation is considered between children of same parents only. Hence cousins are not considered brother (or sister) .\n2. Given relations meet all the following conditions:\n\nEach person has an unique name, and each name appears in at least one relation (as A, or as B).\nNo name appears more than once as the first part of relation (as A).\nThere is no cyclic relations. For example, the following relations cannot appear simultaneously in some testcase \"A is F1 of B\", \"B is F2 of C\" and \"C is F3 of A\".\n\n3. One can have at most one father and at most one mother. And in Chef's land no one takes divorce!\n4. Since you should calculate the minimal fundamental relations between some persons, you need to make some conclusion. For example, if X is father of Y, and Y is brother of Z, then X is father of Z.\n\nInput\nThe first line contains two integers N, number of people, and R, number of relations. Then R lines follow. Each line contains a relation of form \"A is F of B\".\nThe next line contains integer Q, number of queries.

        "prompt": "### Prompt\nChef spent N days working really hard! He planned loads of tasks: as many as Ai tasks to do on the ith day! Chef's work was brutal, so he only managed to finish Bi tasks on the ith day.\nThe good news is that Chef has a Time Machine! \nThe Time Machine has K white buttons and M black buttons. Each button has a positive integer printed on it. Now Chef goes through all N days consequently and presses buttons. Each day Chef can only press one button (either white or black). After using a button once, it becomes inactive.\nPressing a white button with integer x printed on it reduces the number of planned tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this white button can only be pressed if number of planned tasks on the day are greater than or equal to x.\nPressing a black button with integer x printed on it increases the number of completed tasks on the day it was pressed by exactly x. Note that this black button can only be pressed if after pressing it, number of completed tasks don't exceed the number of tasks.\nChef is interested in finding the minimum possible amount of total uncompleted tasks he will still be left with after N days using the Machine in the best way?\nBe careful! Time is sensitive! Chef cannot make a day when he completed more tasks then planned, as this may result in a more-work-than-planned paradox, killing all lazy people on the planet!\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers \u2014 N, K, M \u2014 denoting the number of days, white and black buttons appropriately.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, \u2026 , AN, denoting the number of planned tasks.\nThe third line contains N space-separated integers B1, B2, \u2026 , BN, denoting the number of completed tasks.\nThe fourth line contains K space-separated integers C1, C2, \u2026 , CK, denoting the integers on white buttons.\nThe fifth and last line contains M space-separated integers D1, D2, \u2026 , DM, denoting the integers on black buttons.\n\n\nOutput\n\nIn a single line, output an integer \u2014 the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks.\n\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 4\n1 \u2264 N, K, M \u2264 10^5\n1 \u2264 Bi \u2264 Ai  \u2264 10^5\n1 \u2264 Ci, Di  \u2264 10^5\n\n\nExample\nInput:\n1\n4 2 2 \n5 7 6 1\n3 3 1 1\n6 3\n1 4\n\nOutput:\n3\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1.\nIn this example Chef goes through the following steps:\nUse black button 1 on the first day.\nUse black button 4 on the second day.\nUse white button 3 on the third day.\nThe arrays A and B are now effectively changed to:\n5 7 3 1\n4 7 1 1\nSo he will have 3 uncompleted tasks.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",
