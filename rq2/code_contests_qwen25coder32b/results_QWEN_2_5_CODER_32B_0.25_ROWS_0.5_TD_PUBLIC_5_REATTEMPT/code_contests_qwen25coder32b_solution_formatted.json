Of course, these transceivers have a limited range so if two are too far apart, they cannot communicate directly.\n\n\nThe Chef invested in top-of-the-line transceivers which have a few advanced features. One is that even if two people cannot talk directly because they are out of range, if there is another transceiver that is close enough to both, then the two transceivers can still communicate with each other using the third transceiver as an intermediate device.\n\n\nThere has been a minor emergency in the Chef's restaurant\nand he needs to communicate with both the head server and the sous-chef right away. Help the Chef determine if it is possible for all three people to communicate with each other, even if two must communicate through the third because they are too far apart.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single positive integer T \u2264 100 indicating the number of test cases to follow. The first line of each test case contains a positive integer R \u2264 1,000 indicating that two transceivers can communicate directly without an intermediate transceiver if they are at most R meters away from each other. The remaining three lines of the test case describe the current locations of the Chef, the head server, and the sous-chef, respectively. Each such line contains two integers X,Y (at most 10,000 in absolute value) indicating that the respective person is located at position X,Y.\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case you are to output a single line containing a single string. If it is possible for all three to communicate then you should output \"yes\". Otherwise, you should output \"no\".\n\n\nTo be clear, we say that two transceivers are close enough to communicate directly if the length of the straight line connecting their X,Y coordinates is at most R.\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n3\n1\n0 1\n0 0\n1 0\n2\n0 1\n0 0\n1 0\n2\n0 0\n0 2\n2 1\n\n\nOutput:\nyes\nyes\nno\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

For example, the string S = 7477447 is balanced since S[1, 4] = 7477 has 1 digit 4 and S[5, 7] = 447 has 1 digit 7. On the other hand, one can verify that the string S = 7 is not balanced.\n The Little Elephant has the string S of the length N. He wants to know the number of such pairs of integers (L; R) that 1 \u2264 L \u2264 R \u2264 N and the substring S[L, R]  is balanced. Help him to find this number.\nNotes.\n\nLet S be some lucky string. Then\n\n\n|S| denotes the length of the string S;\n\nS[i] (1 \u2264 i \u2264 |S|) denotes the i^th character of S (the numeration of characters starts from 1);\n\n S[L, R] (1 \u2264 L \u2264 R \u2264 |S|) denotes the string with the following sequence of characters: S[L], S[L + 1], ..., S[R], and is called a substring of S.

As you may know this algorithm shuffles the sequence randomly until it is sorted. Johnny decided that we don't need to shuffle the whole sequence every time. If after the last shuffle several first elements end up in the right places we will fix them and don't shuffle those elements furthermore. We will do the same for the last elements if they are in the right places. For example, if the initial sequence is (3, 5, 1, 6, 4, 2) and after one shuffle Johnny gets (1, 2, 5, 4, 3, 6) he will fix 1, 2 and 6 and proceed with sorting (5, 4, 3) using the same algorithm. Johnny hopes that this optimization will significantly improve the algorithm. Help him calculate the expected amount of shuffles for the improved algorithm to sort the sequence of the first n natural numbers given that no elements are in the right places initially.\n\nInput\nThe first line of input file is number t - the number of test cases.

Here the colors are numbered from 1 to M.\nFor any cell i, Chef can repaint it with any color q, and the cost of such operation is Ci,q points.\nHowever Chef can do at most K repaintings (0 repaintings is possible). \nAfter performing all repaintings, each cell will have some color. For each cell i, if cell i has color q then Chef will receive Bi,q points.\n\nNow Chef is wondering how many points can he receive in total when he repaints optimally.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, M and K, denoting the number of cells and the number of colors, the maximal possible number of repaintings respectively. The next line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN, denoting the initial colors of the cells. Then N lines follow. The i^th line of them contains M integers Bi1, Bi2, ..., BiM, where Bij denotes how many points Chef will receive if the cell i will be painted with j-th color after all operations. Then N lines follow. The i^th line  of them contains M integers Ci1, Ci2, ..., CiM, where Cij denotes how many points Chef will lose if he repaints the cell i with color j.\n\nNote: Be careful that the size of input files can be large.\n\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the maximal possible points.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 5\n0 \u2264 K \u2264 1000\n1 \u2264 N, M \u2264 1000\n1 \u2264 Ai \u2264 M\n0 \u2264 Bi,j \u2264 1000\n0 \u2264 Ci,j \u2264 1000\nIf j = Ai, then Ci,j = 0\n\n\nExample\nInput:\n1\n4 2 1\n1 1 2 2\n1 1\n1 1\n1 1\n3 1\n0 1\n0 1\n1 0\n1 0\n\nOutput:\n5\n\nExplanation:\n For this sample, we can repaint only once, since K = 1.

If the first player choose to move (5,6) to (5,1) the second player will make it to (1,1). So regardless of the move of the first player, the second will always win.\nExample case 3.

You can read the page once before attempting the problem if you wish, nonetheless we will be providing all the information needed here itself.\n\n\nLaddu Accrual System is our new goodie distribution program. In this program, we will be distributing Laddus in place of goodies for your winnings and various other activities (described below), that you perform on our system. Once you collect enough number of Laddus, you can then redeem them to get yourself anything from a wide range of CodeChef goodies.\n\n\nLet us know about various activities and amount of laddus you get corresponding to them.\n\nContest Win (CodeChef\u2019s Long, Cook-Off, LTIME, or any contest hosted with us) : 300 + Bonus (Bonus = 20 - contest rank). Note that if your rank is > 20, then you won't get any bonus.\nTop Contributor on Discuss : 300\nBug Finder\t: 50 - 1000 (depending on the bug severity). It may also fetch you a CodeChef internship! \nContest Hosting\t : 50 \n\n\nYou can do a checkout for redeeming laddus once a month. The minimum laddus redeemable at Check Out are 200 for Indians and 400 for the rest of the world.\n\n\nYou are given history of various activities of a user. The user has not redeemed any of the its laddus accrued.. Now the user just wants to redeem as less amount of laddus he/she can, so that the laddus can last for as long as possible. Find out for how many maximum number of months he can redeem the laddus.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer T denoting number of test cases\nFor each test case:\n\nFirst line contains an integer followed by a string denoting activities, origin respectively, where activities denotes number of activities of the user, origin denotes whether the user is Indian or the rest of the world. origin can be \"INDIAN\" or \"NON_INDIAN\".\nFor each of the next activities lines, each line contains an activity. \n\t\t\tAn activity can be of four types as defined above. \n\nContest Win : Input will be of form of CONTEST_WON rank, where rank denotes the rank of the user. \nTop Contributor : Input will be of form of TOP_CONTRIBUTOR.\nBug Finder : Input will be of form of BUG_FOUND severity, where severity denotes the severity of the bug. \nContest Hosting : Input will be of form of CONTEST_HOSTED.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, find out the maximum number of months for which the user can redeem the laddus accrued.\n\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T, activities \u2264 100\n1 \u2264 rank \u2264 5000\n50 \u2264 severity \u2264 1000\n\n\nExample\nInput:\n2\n4 INDIAN\nCONTEST_WON 1\nTOP_CONTRIBUTOR\nBUG_FOUND 100\nCONTEST_HOSTED\n4 NON_INDIAN\nCONTEST_WON 1\nTOP_CONTRIBUTOR\nBUG_FOUND 100\nCONTEST_HOSTED\n\nOutput:\n3\n1\n\nExplanation\nIn the first example, \n\nFor winning contest with rank 1, user gets 300 + 20 - 1 = 319 laddus. \nFor top contributor, user gets 300 laddus. \nFor finding a bug with severity of 100, user gets 100 laddus. \nFor hosting a contest, user gets 50 laddus. \n\n\nSo, overall user gets 319 + 300 + 100 + 50 = 769 laddus.\nNow, the user is an Indian user, he can redeem only 200 laddus per month. So, for first three months, he will redeem 200 * 3 = 600 laddus. The remaining 169 laddus, he can not redeem as he requires at least 200 laddues in a month to redeem. \nSo, answer is 3.\n\nIn the second example, user is a non-Indian user, he can redeem 400 laddues per month. So, in the first month, he will redeem 400 laddus. The remaining 369 laddus, he can not redeem as he requires at least 400 laddues in a month to redeem. \nSo, answer is 1.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

For a regular player the look of the field seems pretty random, but the programmer in you recognizes the following pattern: the i-th cell on the n-th row contains C(n, i) coins if and only if 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n, all other cells are blocked. Record C(n, i) denotes binomial coefficient \"n choose i\".\nThe player starts from the cell situated at row R and column C in the matrix. The objective is to collect exactly G number of coins from matrix in several moves. There are some rules: \n\nOn each move the player must collect all the coins from some unblocked cell in the current column.\nThe rules of the game state, that player mustn't be really greedy, so the number of coins he collected must not increase. In other words, if at some move the player collected X coins then further he cannot collect more than X coins in a single move.\nAfter each move, the player is immediately moved to some cell of the column W-1 (where W denotes the current column of the player).

For each of the words of the forgotten language, your task is to determine whether the word is still in use in any of these K modern phrases or not.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\n\n\nThe first line of a test case description contains two space separated positive integers N and K.\n\n\nThe second line of the description contains N strings denoting a dictionary of the forgotten language.\n\n\nEach of the next K lines of the description starts with one positive integer L denoting the number of words in the corresponding phrase in modern languages. The integer is followed by L strings (not necessarily distinct) denoting the phrase.\n\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing N tokens (space-separated): if the i^th word of the dictionary exists in at least one phrase in modern languages, then you should output YES as the i^th token, otherwise NO.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 20\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 100\n1 \u2264 K, L \u2264 50\n1 \u2264 length of any string in the input \u2264 5\n\n\nExample\nInput:\n2\n3 2\npiygu ezyfo rzotm\n1 piygu\n6 tefwz tefwz piygu ezyfo tefwz piygu\n4 1\nkssdy tjzhy ljzym kegqz\n4 kegqz kegqz kegqz vxvyj\n\nOutput:\nYES YES NO \nNO NO NO YES\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

He went to watch this year's Indian Grand Prix at New Delhi. He noticed that one segment of the circuit was a long straight road. It was impossible for a car to overtake other cars on this segment. Therefore, a car had to lower down its speed if there was a slower car in front of it. While watching the race, Chef started to wonder how many cars were moving at their maximum speed.\nFormally, you're given the maximum speed of N cars in the order they entered the long straight segment of the circuit. Each car prefers to move at its maximum speed. If that's not possible because of the front car being slow, it might have to lower its speed. It still moves at the fastest possible speed while avoiding any collisions. For the purpose of this problem, you can assume that the straight segment is infinitely long.\nCount the number of cars which were moving at their maximum speed on the straight segment.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases to follow.

Yesterday he had enumerated the nodes of the tree in such a way: \n\nLet's call the nodes' level a number of nodes that occur on the way to this node from the root, including this node. This way, only the root has the level equal to 1, while only its two sons has the level equal to 2.\nThen, let's take all the nodes with the odd level and enumerate them with consecutive odd numbers, starting from the smallest levels and the leftmost nodes, going to the rightmost nodes and the highest levels.\nThen, let's take all the nodes with the even level and enumerate them with consecutive even numbers, starting from the smallest levels and the leftmost nodes, going to the rightmost nodes and the highest levels.\nFor the better understanding there is an example: \n\n\n                             1\n                        /           \\\n                  2                   4\n                /   \\                /       \\\n             3       5           7        9\n            / \\      /  \\          /  \\       /  \\\n           6  8 10 12      14 16   18 20 \nHere you can see the visualization of the process. For example, in odd levels, the root was enumerated first, then, there were enumerated roots' left sons' sons and roots' right sons' sons.\nYou are given the string of symbols, let's call it S. Each symbol is either l or r. Naturally, this sequence denotes some path from the root, where l means going to the left son and r means going to the right son.\nPlease, help Chef to determine the number of the last node in this path.\n\nInput\nThe first line contains single integer T number of test cases.\nEach of next T lines contain a string S consisting only of the symbols l and r.\n\n\nOutput\nPer each line output the number of the last node in the path, described by S, modulo 10^9+7.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 |T| \u2264 5\n1 \u2264 |S| \u2264 10^5\nRemember that the tree is infinite, so each path described by appropriate S is a correct one.\n\n\nExample\nInput:\n4\nlrl\nrll\nr\nlllr\nOutput:\n10\n14\n4\n13\n\n\n\nExplanation\nSee the example in the statement for better understanding the samples.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

The same is the case with right side. \nA connection between two spots requires a wire of length equal to the distance between the two.\n\n\nThe realm has already purchased a wire of M miles long from Nokia, \npossibly the wire will be cut into smaller length wires. \nAs we can observe, the total length of the used wire depends on the permutation of the spots P.

Teams like Snow Kids, Shadows, Xenons, Red Tigers, Wambas, Pirates, etc. are in total enthusiasm and are practising hard to win the cup using their talent and flux.\nEach planet of the galaxy has a government. Some governments have a mutual agreement between them. If planet A has mutual agreement with planet B, then there is a bidirectional spaceway between A and B using which anybody can go from A to B and vice-versa. People can use these spaceways to travel from one planet to another, if there exists a path between them using some of the spaceways.\nEach planet has it's own football ground. The GFA has planned the matches in such a way that a team can have a match at any of these grounds. The GFA has come across some problems in the execution of their plan. They have found out that there are many pairs of planets between which there does not exist any path, so the football team of one of those planets can't reach the other planet. They requested the corresponding governments to make a spaceway between them, but because of absense of mutual agreement (duhhh.. Politics!), these goverment did not agree. So the GFA suggested that they will make teleports between some pairs of planets which will be used only by the football teams to travel.\nBut there are two types of governments in the galaxy\n1. Some of the governments are greedy (duhhh..). They want to make money (You don't say!) throught the GFA. So each of these government has asked the GFA for a tax value which it has to pay if it wants to make a teleport ending at their planet.\n2. Others want to sponser the event, so they will give money to the GFA if they make a teleport ending at their planet (That's new..). The GFA would always avoid such governments no matter what the consequences are, because these kind of governments have always some dirty plans in their minds for the GFA.\nNow, the GFA wants to make bi-directional teleports between planets such that the football teams of any planet can reach any other planet to play a football match, using spaceways between the planets and/or teleports made by the GFA.\nThe GFA also has financial problems and want to spend as little money as possible. They have come to you so that you can help them calculate the minimum ammount of money needed to fulfill their plan.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input consists of two integers - N and M. N is number of planets and M is number of pairs of planets which have a mutual agreement, i.e they have a spaceway between them. Then, M lines follow, each containing two space separated integers A and B, denoting a mutual agreement and hence a spaceway to travel, between plenet A and planet B. Then, N lines follow. The i^th line has an integer C. If C \u2265 0, then it represents the tax value which the GFA has to pay to the government of planet i (it's a type 1 government). If C < 0, then it represents the money the ith government will pay to the GFA (it's a type 2 government).\n\nOutput\nPrint the minimum amount needed for the GFA to fulfill their plan if it can be fulfilled, else print \"-1\" (without quotes).\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 100,000\n0 \u2264 M \u2264 1,000,000\n0 \u2264 |C| \u2264 10,000\n1 \u2264 A,B \u2264 N\nA \u2260 B\n\nSample\n\nInput 1\n6 6\n1 2\n2 3\n1 3\n4 5\n5 6\n4 6\n1\n3\n5\n2\n4\n6\n\nOutput 1\n3\n\n\nInput 2\n3 1\n2 3\n1\n-1\n-1\n\nOutput 2\n-1\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

For example, strings \"47\", \"744\", \"4\" are lucky while \"5\", \"17\", \"467\" are not.\n\n\nThe Little Elephant has the strings A and B of digits. These strings are of equal lengths, that is |A| = |B|. He wants to get some lucky string from them. For this he performs the following operations. At first he arbitrary reorders digits of A. Then he arbitrary reorders digits of B. After that he creates the string C such that its i-th digit is the maximum between the i-th digit of A and the i-th digit of B. In other words, C[i] = max{A[i], B[i]} for i from 1 to |A|. After that he removes from C all non-lucky digits saving the order of the remaining (lucky) digits. So C now becomes a lucky string. For example, if after reordering A = \"754\" and B = \"873\", then C is at first \"874\" and then it becomes \"74\".\n\n\nThe Little Elephant wants the resulting string to be as lucky as possible. The formal definition of this is that the resulting string should be the lexicographically greatest possible string among all the strings that can be obtained from the given strings A and B by the described process.\n\nNotes\n\n|A| denotes the length of the string A.\nA[i] denotes the i-th digit of the string A. Here we numerate the digits starting from 1. So 1 \u2264 i \u2264 |A|.\nThe string A is called lexicographically greater than the string B if either there exists some index i such that A[i] > B[i] and for each j < i we have A[j] = B[j], or B is a proper prefix of A, that is, |A| > |B| and first |B| digits of A coincide with the corresponding digits of B.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains the string A. The second line contains the string B.\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case output a single line containing the answer for the corresponding test case. Note, that the answer can be an empty string. In this case you should print an empty line for the corresponding test case.\n\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 10000\n1 \u2264 |A| \u2264 20000\n|A| = |B|\nEach character of A and B is a digit.\nSum of |A| across all the tests in the input does not exceed 200000.\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n4\n4\n7\n435\n479\n7\n8\n1675475\n9756417\n\nOutput:\n7\n74\n\n777744\n\n\nExplanation\n\nCase 1. In this case the only possible string C we can get is \"7\" and it is the lucky string.\n\n\nCase 2. If we reorder A and B as A = \"543\" and B = \"749\" the string C will be at first \"749\" and then becomes \"74\". It can be shown that this is the lexicographically greatest string for the given A and B.\n\n\nCase 3. In this case the only possible string C we can get is \"8\" and it becomes and empty string after removing of non-lucky digits.\n\n\nCase 4. If we reorder A and B as A = \"7765541\" and B = \"5697714\" the string C will be at first \"7797744\" and then becomes \"777744\". Note that we can construct any lexicographically greater string for the given A and B since we have only four \"sevens\" and two \"fours\" among digits of both strings A and B as well the constructed string \"777744\".\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

    "prompt": "### Prompt\nDigory Kirke and Polly Plummer are two kids living next door to each other. The attics of the two houses are connected to each other through a passage. Digory's Uncle Andrew has been secretly doing strange things in the attic of his house, and he always ensures that the room is locked. Being curious, Digory suspects that there is another route into the attic through Polly's house, and being curious as kids always are, they wish to find out what it is that Uncle Andrew is secretly up to.\n\n\nSo they start from Polly's house, and walk along the passageway to Digory's. Unfortunately, along the way, they suddenly find that some of the floorboards are missing, and that taking a step forward would have them plummet to their deaths below.\n\n\nDejected, but determined, they return to Polly's house, and decide to practice long-jumping in the yard before they re-attempt the crossing of the passage. It takes them exactly one day to master long-jumping a certain length. Also, once they have mastered jumping a particular length L, they are able to jump any amount less than equal to L as well.\n\n\nThe next day they return to their mission, but somehow find that there is another place further up the passage, that requires them to jump even more than they had practiced for. So they go back and repeat the process.\n\n\nNote the following:\n\n At each point, they are able to sense only how much they need to jump at that point, and have no idea of the further reaches of the passage till they reach there. That is, they are able to only see how far ahead is the next floorboard. \n The amount they choose to practice for their jump is exactly the amount they need to get across that particular part of the passage. That is, if they can currently jump upto a length L0, and they require to jump a length L1(> L0) at that point, they will practice jumping length L1 that day. \n They start by being able to \"jump\" a length of 1. \n\n\nFind how many days it will take them to cross the passageway. In the input, the passageway is described as a string P of '#'s and '.'s. A '#' represents a floorboard, while a '.' represents the absence of a floorboard. The string, when read from left to right, describes the passage from Polly's house to Digory's, and not vice-versa.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line consists of a single integer T, the number of testcases.\nEach of the next T lines consist of the string P for that case.\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each case, output the number of days it takes them to cross the passage.\n\n\nConstraints\n\n 1  \u2264 T  \u2264 1,000,000  (10^6)\n 1  \u2264 |P|  \u2264 1,000,000 (10^6)\n The total length of P will be \u2264 5,000,000 (5 * 10^6)across all test-cases of a test-file \n P will consist of only the characters # and . \n The first and the last characters of P will be #. \n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n4\n####\n##.#..#\n##..#.#\n##.#....#\n\nOutput:\n0\n2\n1\n2\n\nExplanation\n\nFor the first example, they do not need to learn any jump size. They are able to cross the entire passage by \"jumping\" lengths 1-1-1.\n\n\nFor the second example case, they get stuck at the first '.', and take one day learning to jump length 2. When they come back the next day, they get stuck at '..' and take one day to learn to jump length 3.\n\n\nFor the third example case, they get stuck first at '..', and they take one day to learn to jump length 3. On the second day, they are able to jump both length 3 as well as length 2 required to cross the passage.\n\n\nFor the last test case they need to stop and learn jumping two times. At first they need to jump a length 2 and then a length 5.\n\n\nAppendix\n\nIrrelevant to the problem description, if you're curious about what Uncle Andrew was up to, he was experimenting on Magic Rings that could facilitate travel between worlds. One such world, as some of you might have heard of, was Narnia.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

Rows are numbered 1 to N, from top to bottom. Columns are numbered 1 to M, from left to right. You are initially at cell (1, 1) and want to go to cell (N, M). From any cell you can move to the cell below it or to the cell right to it. You should never go out of the grid. At any point you should consider all the possibilities of movement with equal probability\nLet P[i][j] be the probability of visiting cell (i, j). You need to calculate the sum of P[i][j] for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 N, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 M.\nAs we all know, Tojo really hates probability related problems. He wants you to solve this task\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.Only line of each test case has two integer N and M.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the required answer.

So the probablity of visiting (1, 1) is 1. At (1, 1) you have 2 options, move below to (2, 1) or to right cell (1, 2). Probablity of going to (1, 2) is 0.5. Probability of going to (2, 1) is 0.5. You always end up at (2, 2), so P[2][2] is 1. Required sum = 1.0 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 1.0 = 3.0\nExample case 2\nProbability matrix P for N=1, M=6 is\n1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0\nBecause at any position there is only one possible next position.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

If you have A dollars and B cents remaining in your purse after depositing the C cents, then after the transformation you will have B dollars and A cents. You can repeat this procedure as many times as you want unless you don't have enough money for the machine. If at any point C > B and A > 0, then the machine will allow you to break one of the A dollars into 100 cents so you can place C cents in the machine. The machine will not allow you to exchange a dollar for 100 cents if B >= C.\n \nOf course, you want to do this to maximize your profit. For example if C=69 and you have 9 dollars and 77 cents then after you put 69 cents in the machine you will have 8 dollars and 9 cents (9.77 --> 9.08 --> 8.09). But I should warn you that you can't cheat. If you try to throw away 9 cents before the transformation (in order to obtain 99 dollars and 8 cents after), the machine will sense you are cheating and take away all of your money.

For example, if Chef has two strings A = \"Codechef\" and B = \"elfedcc\", then the longest common pattern length of A and B is 5 (common characters are c, d, e, e, f).\nChef wants to test you with the problem described above. He will give you two strings of Latin alphabets and digits, return him the longest common pattern length.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Then the description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a string A. The next line contains another character string B.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing a single integer, the longest common pattern length between A and B.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 100\n1 \u2264 |A|, |B| \u2264 10000 (10^4), where |S| denotes the length of the string S\nBoth of A and B can contain only alphabet characters (both lower and upper case) and digits\n\n\nExample\nInput:\n4\nabcd\nxyz\nabcd\nbcda\naabc\nacaa\nCodechef\nelfedcc\n\nOutput:\n0\n4\n3\n5\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1.

In this situation, variables are also known as unknowns and the values which satisfy the equality are known as solutions. An equation differs from an identity in that an equation is not necessarily true for all possible values of the variable.\nThere are many types of equations, and they are found in all areas of mathematics. For instance, a linear equation is an algebraic equation in which each term is either a constant or the product of a constant and (the first power of) a single variable.\nIn this problem we'll consider quite a special kind of systems of linear equations. To be more specific, you are given a system of N linear equations of the following form:\n\nx2 + x3 + ... + xN - 1 + xN = a1\nx1 + x3 + ... + xN - 1 + xN = a2\n...\nx1 + x2 + ... + xN - 2 + xN = aN - 1\nx1 + x2 + ... + xN - 2 + xN - 1 = aN\n\nIn other words, i'th equation of the system consists of the sum of all the variable x1, ..., xN except xi to the left of the equality sign and the constant ai to the right of the equality sign.\nOne can easily prove, that a system of linear equations as described above always have exactly one solution in case N is greater than one. Your task is to find the solution of the system(such a sequence x1, x2, ..., xN, that turns each of the equations into equality).

Each test case begins with two integers n and m. Here, n is the number of employees (between 2 and 1000) and m is the number of compatible pairs of employees (between 1 and 10,000). The employees are numbered from 0 to n-1. The next m lines describe a pair of compatible employees, one per line. The i'th such line contains two distinct integers ui,vi between 0 and n-1. Strangely enough, the Chef estimates that picking the i'th pair ui,vi will increase the quality of food prepared in his kitchen by exactly 2^i.\n\n\nNo pair of employees will be given more than once in the input. That is, for distinct indices i and j, we do not have both ui = uj and vi = vj, nor do we have both ui = vj and vi = uj.\n\n\nOutput\n\nThe output for each test case consists of the indices of the pairs of employees that are used in a maximum total value pairing (the indices are between 0 and m-1). These indices should be given in increasing order with a single space between consecutive numbers. If there is more than one possible output, then any will do.\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n2\n4 5\n0 1\n1 2\n2 3\n1 3\n3 0\n4 3\n0 1\n2 3\n2 1\n\nOutput:\n1 4\n2\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

Then, the perfume spreads from one house (need not be inhabited by people) to all its adjacent houses in one second, and the cycle continues.

The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of a test case contains a string S1.\nThe second line of a test case contains a string S2. \nBoth strings consist of lowercase Latin letters and question marks in places where the symbols are unreadable.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output the minimal and the maximal difference between two given strings separated with a single space.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 100\n1 \u2264 |S1|, |S2| \u2264 100\nExample\nInput:\n3\na?c\n??b\n???a\n???a\n?abac\naba?w\n\nOutput:\n1 3\n0 3\n3 5\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1. You can change the question marks in the strings so that you obtain S1 = abc and S2 = abb. Then S1 and S2 will differ in one position. On the other hand, you can change the letters so that S1 = abc and S2 = bab. Then, the strings will differ in all three positions.\nExample case 2. Change the question marks this way: S1 = dcba, S2 = dcba, then the strings will differ in 0 positions. You can also change the question marks so that S1 = aaaa, S2 = dcba, then the strings will differ in 3 positions.\nExample case 3. Change the question marks this way: S1 = aabac, S2 = abaaw, then the strings will differ in 3 positions. Then, change the question marks this way: S1 = xabac, S2 = abayw, then they will differ in 5 positions.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

Vlad was the happiest man in the world! Now he can listen his favorite songs whenever he wants!\nVlad built up his own playlist. The playlist consists of N songs, each has a unique positive integer length. Vlad likes all the songs from his playlist, but there is a song, which he likes more than the others. It's named \"Uncle Johny\".\nAfter creation of the playlist, Vlad decided to sort the songs in increasing order of their lengths. For example, if the lengths of the songs in playlist was {1, 3, 5, 2, 4} after sorting it becomes {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Before the sorting, \"Uncle Johny\" was on K-th position (1-indexing is assumed for the playlist) in the playlist.\nVlad needs your help! He gives you all the information of his playlist.

Using these fundamental relations we can describe all other relations between relatives. For example, one can say that Chef Prime is son of daughter of sister of father of father of Chef Composite.\nYou are given R relations of form \"A is F of B\", for N people from the party. There variable F is one of the following strings: father, mother, son, daughter, brother, sister. Also you are given Q queries of Little Joe, each query has form \"X Y\". For each query output the distance between persons X and Y. Distance is equal to the minimal number of fundamental relations appearing while describing the relation between X and Y. For example distance between Chef Prime and Chef Composite is 5. \nImportant points:\n1. Here brother (or sister) relation is considered between children of same parents only. Hence cousins are not considered brother (or sister) .\n2. Given relations meet all the following conditions:\n\nEach person has an unique name, and each name appears in at least one relation (as A, or as B).\nNo name appears more than once as the first part of relation (as A).\nThere is no cyclic relations. For example, the following relations cannot appear simultaneously in some testcase \"A is F1 of B\", \"B is F2 of C\" and \"C is F3 of A\".\n\n3. One can have at most one father and at most one mother. And in Chef's land no one takes divorce!\n4.

Description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains three integers \u2014 N, K, M \u2014 denoting the number of days, white and black buttons appropriately.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, \u2026 , AN, denoting the number of planned tasks.\nThe third line contains N space-separated integers B1, B2, \u2026 , BN, denoting the number of completed tasks.\nThe fourth line contains K space-separated integers C1, C2, \u2026 , CK, denoting the integers on white buttons.\nThe fifth and last line contains M space-separated integers D1, D2, \u2026 , DM, denoting the integers on black buttons.\n\n\nOutput\n\nIn a single line, output an integer \u2014 the minimum possible amount of uncompleted tasks.\n\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 4\n1 \u2264 N, K, M \u2264 10^5\n1 \u2264 Bi \u2264 Ai  \u2264 10^5\n1 \u2264 Ci, Di  \u2264 10^5\n\n\nExample\nInput:\n1\n4 2 2 \n5 7 6 1\n3 3 1 1\n6 3\n1 4\n\nOutput:\n3\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1.\nIn this example Chef goes through the following steps:\nUse black button 1 on the first day.\nUse black button 4 on the second day.\nUse white button 3 on the third day.\nThe arrays A and B are now effectively changed to:\n5 7 3 1\n4 7 1 1\nSo he will have 3 uncompleted tasks.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

The boy asked you to come up with an algorithm, that could play the following game: \nLet's define f(n) as the sum of all odd divisors of n. I.e. f(10) = 1 + 5 = 6 and f(21) = 1 + 3 + 7 + 21 = 32. The game is to calculate f(l) + f(l + 1) + ... + f(r - 1) + f(r) for the given integers l and r.\nHave fun! But be careful, the integers might be quite big.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains one integer T denoting the number of test cases.\nThe only line of the test case description contains two positive integers l and r.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output the required sum on a separate line.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 10\n1 \u2264 l \u2264 r \u2264 10^5\n\n\nExample\nInput:\n2\n1 10\n42 42\n\nOutput:\n45\n32\n\nExplanation\nIn the first example case, f(1) + f(2) + ... + f(10) = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 6 + 4 + 8 + 1 + 13 + 6 = 45\nIn the second example case, f(42) = 32.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",
