Of course, these transceivers have a limited range so if two are too far apart, they cannot communicate directly.\n\n\nThe Chef invested in top-of-the-line transceivers which have a few advanced features. One is that even if two people cannot talk directly because they are out of range, if there is another transceiver that is close enough to both, then the two transceivers can still communicate with each other using the third transceiver as an intermediate device.\n\n\nThere has been a minor emergency in the Chef's restaurant\nand he needs to communicate with both the head server and the sous-chef right away. Help the Chef determine if it is possible for all three people to communicate with each other, even if two must communicate through the third because they are too far apart.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single positive integer T \u2264 100 indicating the number of test cases to follow. The first line of each test case contains a positive integer R \u2264 1,000 indicating that two transceivers can communicate directly without an intermediate transceiver if they are at most R meters away from each other. The remaining three lines of the test case describe the current locations of the Chef, the head server, and the sous-chef, respectively. Each such line contains two integers X,Y (at most 10,000 in absolute value) indicating that the respective person is located at position X,Y.\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case you are to output a single line containing a single string. If it is possible for all three to communicate then you should output \"yes\". Otherwise, you should output \"no\".\n\n\nTo be clear, we say that two transceivers are close enough to communicate directly if the length of the straight line connecting their X,Y coordinates is at most R.\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n3\n1\n0 1\n0 0\n1 0\n2\n0 1\n0 0\n1 0\n2\n0 0\n0 2\n2 1\n\n\nOutput:\nyes\nyes\nno\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

For example, the string S = 7477447 is balanced since S[1, 4] = 7477 has 1 digit 4 and S[5, 7] = 447 has 1 digit 7. On the other hand, one can verify that the string S = 7 is not balanced.\n The Little Elephant has the string S of the length N.

Here the colors are numbered from 1 to M.\nFor any cell i, Chef can repaint it with any color q, and the cost of such operation is Ci,q points.\nHowever Chef can do at most K repaintings (0 repaintings is possible). \nAfter performing all repaintings, each cell will have some color. For each cell i, if cell i has color q then Chef will receive Bi,q points.\n\nNow Chef is wondering how many points can he receive in total when he repaints optimally.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, M and K, denoting the number of cells and the number of colors, the maximal possible number of repaintings respectively. The next line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN, denoting the initial colors of the cells. Then N lines follow. The i^th line of them contains M integers Bi1, Bi2, ..., BiM, where Bij denotes how many points Chef will receive if the cell i will be painted with j-th color after all operations. Then N lines follow. The i^th line  of them contains M integers Ci1, Ci2, ..., CiM, where Cij denotes how many points Chef will lose if he repaints the cell i with color j.\n\nNote: Be careful that the size of input files can be large.\n\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the maximal possible points.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 5\n0 \u2264 K \u2264 1000\n1 \u2264 N, M \u2264 1000\n1 \u2264 Ai \u2264 M\n0 \u2264 Bi,j \u2264 1000\n0 \u2264 Ci,j \u2264 1000\nIf j = Ai, then Ci,j = 0\n\n\nExample\nInput:\n1\n4 2 1\n1 1 2 2\n1 1\n1 1\n1 1\n3 1\n0 1\n0 1\n1 0\n1 0\n\nOutput:\n5\n\nExplanation:\n For this sample, we can repaint only once, since K = 1.

We will pay 1 for this, and receive: \n1 (1^st cell - 1^st color) + \n1 (2^nd cell -1^st color) + \n1 (3^rd cell - 2^nd color) + \n3 (4^th cell - 1^st color)  = 6.\nHence we get 6 \u2212 1 = 5 points in total, and it is the optimal answer.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

If the first player choose to move (5,6) to (5,1) the second player will make it to (1,1). So regardless of the move of the first player, the second will always win.\nExample case 3.

You can read the page once before attempting the problem if you wish, nonetheless we will be providing all the information needed here itself.\n\n\nLaddu Accrual System is our new goodie distribution program. In this program, we will be distributing Laddus in place of goodies for your winnings and various other activities (described below), that you perform on our system. Once you collect enough number of Laddus, you can then redeem them to get yourself anything from a wide range of CodeChef goodies.\n\n\nLet us know about various activities and amount of laddus you get corresponding to them.\n\nContest Win (CodeChef\u2019s Long, Cook-Off, LTIME, or any contest hosted with us) : 300 + Bonus (Bonus = 20 - contest rank). Note that if your rank is > 20, then you won't get any bonus.\nTop Contributor on Discuss : 300\nBug Finder\t: 50 - 1000 (depending on the bug severity). It may also fetch you a CodeChef internship! \nContest Hosting\t : 50 \n\n\nYou can do a checkout for redeeming laddus once a month. The minimum laddus redeemable at Check Out are 200 for Indians and 400 for the rest of the world.\n\n\nYou are given history of various activities of a user. The user has not redeemed any of the its laddus accrued.. Now the user just wants to redeem as less amount of laddus he/she can, so that the laddus can last for as long as possible. Find out for how many maximum number of months he can redeem the laddus.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer T denoting number of test cases\nFor each test case:\n\nFirst line contains an integer followed by a string denoting activities, origin respectively, where activities denotes number of activities of the user, origin denotes whether the user is Indian or the rest of the world. origin can be \"INDIAN\" or \"NON_INDIAN\".\nFor each of the next activities lines, each line contains an activity. \n\t\t\tAn activity can be of four types as defined above. \n\nContest Win : Input will be of form of CONTEST_WON rank, where rank denotes the rank of the user. \nTop Contributor : Input will be of form of TOP_CONTRIBUTOR.\nBug Finder : Input will be of form of BUG_FOUND severity, where severity denotes the severity of the bug. \nContest Hosting : Input will be of form of CONTEST_HOSTED.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, find out the maximum number of months for which the user can redeem the laddus accrued.\n\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T, activities \u2264 100\n1 \u2264 rank \u2264 5000\n50 \u2264 severity \u2264 1000\n\n\nExample\nInput:\n2\n4 INDIAN\nCONTEST_WON 1\nTOP_CONTRIBUTOR\nBUG_FOUND 100\nCONTEST_HOSTED\n4 NON_INDIAN\nCONTEST_WON 1\nTOP_CONTRIBUTOR\nBUG_FOUND 100\nCONTEST_HOSTED\n\nOutput:\n3\n1\n\nExplanation\nIn the first example, \n\nFor winning contest with rank 1, user gets 300 + 20 - 1 = 319 laddus. \nFor top contributor, user gets 300 laddus. \nFor finding a bug with severity of 100, user gets 100 laddus. \nFor hosting a contest, user gets 50 laddus. \n\n\nSo, overall user gets 319 + 300 + 100 + 50 = 769 laddus.\nNow, the user is an Indian user, he can redeem only 200 laddus per month. So, for first three months, he will redeem 200 * 3 = 600 laddus. The remaining 169 laddus, he can not redeem as he requires at least 200 laddues in a month to redeem. \nSo, answer is 3.\n\nIn the second example, user is a non-Indian user, he can redeem 400 laddues per month. So, in the first month, he will redeem 400 laddus. The remaining 369 laddus, he can not redeem as he requires at least 400 laddues in a month to redeem. \nSo, answer is 1.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

The rules of \"Bico Grid\" are very simple.\nThe game field is a 100x100 matrix, where each cell is either a blocked cell, or a cell with some number of coins. For a regular player the look of the field seems pretty random, but the programmer in you recognizes the following pattern: the i-th cell on the n-th row contains C(n, i) coins if and only if 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n, all other cells are blocked. Record C(n, i) denotes binomial coefficient \"n choose i\".\nThe player starts from the cell situated at row R and column C in the matrix. The objective is to collect exactly G number of coins from matrix in several moves. There are some rules: \n\nOn each move the player must collect all the coins from some unblocked cell in the current column.\nThe rules of the game state, that player mustn't be really greedy, so the number of coins he collected must not increase. In other words, if at some move the player collected X coins then further he cannot collect more than X coins in a single move.\nAfter each move, the player is immediately moved to some cell of the column W-1 (where W denotes the current column of the player).

Also note that Chef hates to visit the same city twice during his travel. Even the last city should differ from the first. Two consecutive cities in the route should also be different. So you need to check these conditions for the given routes too.\n\nYou will be given the list of all cities and all roads between them with their lengths. All roads are one-way. Also you will be given the list of all travel routes that Chef plans. For each route you should check whether it is correct and find its length in this case.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains positive integer N, the number of cities. The second line contains space separated list of N strings, city names. All city names are distinct.\n\nThe third line contains non-negative integer M, the number of available roads. Each of the next M lines describes one road and contains names C1 and C2 of two cities followed by the positive integer D, the length of the one-way road that connects C1 with C2. It is guaranteed that C1 and C2 will be correct names of two different cities from the list of N cities given in the second line of the input file. For each pair of different cities there is at most one road in each direction and each road will be described exactly once in the input file.\n\nNext line contains positive integer T, the number of travel routes planned by the Chef. Each of the next T lines contains positive integer K followed by K strings, names of cities of the current route. Cities are given in order in which Chef will visit them during his travel.\n\nAll strings in the input file composed only of lowercase, uppercase letters of the English alphabet and hyphens. Each string is non-empty and has length at most 20. If some line of the input file contains more then one element than consecutive elements of this line are separated by exactly one space.

Note that a route composed of exactly one city is always correct provided that city name is written correctly. \nThe 11^th route is incorrect since there is no cities with names Mumbai and Deli.

He went to watch this year's Indian Grand Prix at New Delhi. He noticed that one segment of the circuit was a long straight road. It was impossible for a car to overtake other cars on this segment. Therefore, a car had to lower down its speed if there was a slower car in front of it. While watching the race, Chef started to wonder how many cars were moving at their maximum speed.\nFormally, you're given the maximum speed of N cars in the order they entered the long straight segment of the circuit. Each car prefers to move at its maximum speed. If that's not possible because of the front car being slow, it might have to lower its speed. It still moves at the fastest possible speed while avoiding any collisions. For the purpose of this problem, you can assume that the straight segment is infinitely long.\nCount the number of cars which were moving at their maximum speed on the straight segment.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases to follow.

This way, only the root has the level equal to 1, while only its two sons has the level equal to 2.\nThen, let's take all the nodes with the odd level and enumerate them with consecutive odd numbers, starting from the smallest levels and the leftmost nodes, going to the rightmost nodes and the highest levels.\nThen, let's take all the nodes with the even level and enumerate them with consecutive even numbers, starting from the smallest levels and the leftmost nodes, going to the rightmost nodes and the highest levels.\nFor the better understanding there is an example: \n\n\n                             1\n                        /           \\\n                  2                   4\n                /   \\                /       \\\n             3       5           7        9\n            / \\      /  \\          /  \\       /  \\\n           6  8 10 12      14 16   18 20 \nHere you can see the visualization of the process. For example, in odd levels, the root was enumerated first, then, there were enumerated roots' left sons' sons and roots' right sons' sons.\nYou are given the string of symbols, let's call it S. Each symbol is either l or r. Naturally, this sequence denotes some path from the root, where l means going to the left son and r means going to the right son.\nPlease, help Chef to determine the number of the last node in this path.\n\nInput\nThe first line contains single integer T number of test cases.\nEach of next T lines contain a string S consisting only of the symbols l and r.\n\n\nOutput\nPer each line output the number of the last node in the path, described by S, modulo 10^9+7.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 |T| \u2264 5\n1 \u2264 |S| \u2264 10^5\nRemember that the tree is infinite, so each path described by appropriate S is a correct one.\n\n\nExample\nInput:\n4\nlrl\nrll\nr\nlllr\nOutput:\n10\n14\n4\n13\n\n\n\nExplanation\nSee the example in the statement for better understanding the samples.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

The Galactik Football Assosiation (GFA) has announced a football tournament between all the teams of all the planets in the galaxy (say N). Teams like Snow Kids, Shadows, Xenons, Red Tigers, Wambas, Pirates, etc. are in total enthusiasm and are practising hard to win the cup using their talent and flux.\nEach planet of the galaxy has a government. Some governments have a mutual agreement between them. If planet A has mutual agreement with planet B, then there is a bidirectional spaceway between A and B using which anybody can go from A to B and vice-versa. People can use these spaceways to travel from one planet to another, if there exists a path between them using some of the spaceways.\nEach planet has it's own football ground. The GFA has planned the matches in such a way that a team can have a match at any of these grounds. The GFA has come across some problems in the execution of their plan. They have found out that there are many pairs of planets between which there does not exist any path, so the football team of one of those planets can't reach the other planet. They requested the corresponding governments to make a spaceway between them, but because of absense of mutual agreement (duhhh.. Politics!), these goverment did not agree. So the GFA suggested that they will make teleports between some pairs of planets which will be used only by the football teams to travel.\nBut there are two types of governments in the galaxy\n1. Some of the governments are greedy (duhhh..). They want to make money (You don't say!) throught the GFA. So each of these government has asked the GFA for a tax value which it has to pay if it wants to make a teleport ending at their planet.\n2. Others want to sponser the event, so they will give money to the GFA if they make a teleport ending at their planet (That's new..). The GFA would always avoid such governments no matter what the consequences are, because these kind of governments have always some dirty plans in their minds for the GFA.\nNow, the GFA wants to make bi-directional teleports between planets such that the football teams of any planet can reach any other planet to play a football match, using spaceways between the planets and/or teleports made by the GFA.\nThe GFA also has financial problems and want to spend as little money as possible. They have come to you so that you can help them calculate the minimum ammount of money needed to fulfill their plan.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input consists of two integers - N and M. N is number of planets and M is number of pairs of planets which have a mutual agreement, i.e they have a spaceway between them. Then, M lines follow, each containing two space separated integers A and B, denoting a mutual agreement and hence a spaceway to travel, between plenet A and planet B. Then, N lines follow. The i^th line has an integer C. If C \u2265 0, then it represents the tax value which the GFA has to pay to the government of planet i (it's a type 1 government). If C < 0, then it represents the money the ith government will pay to the GFA (it's a type 2 government).\n\nOutput\nPrint the minimum amount needed for the GFA to fulfill their plan if it can be fulfilled, else print \"-1\" (without quotes).\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 100,000\n0 \u2264 M \u2264 1,000,000\n0 \u2264 |C| \u2264 10,000\n1 \u2264 A,B \u2264 N\nA \u2260 B\n\nSample\n\nInput 1\n6 6\n1 2\n2 3\n1 3\n4 5\n5 6\n4 6\n1\n3\n5\n2\n4\n6\n\nOutput 1\n3\n\n\nInput 2\n3 1\n2 3\n1\n-1\n-1\n\nOutput 2\n-1\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

For example, strings \"47\", \"744\", \"4\" are lucky while \"5\", \"17\", \"467\" are not.\n\n\nThe Little Elephant has the strings A and B of digits. These strings are of equal lengths, that is |A| = |B|. He wants to get some lucky string from them. For this he performs the following operations. At first he arbitrary reorders digits of A. Then he arbitrary reorders digits of B. After that he creates the string C such that its i-th digit is the maximum between the i-th digit of A and the i-th digit of B. In other words, C[i] = max{A[i], B[i]} for i from 1 to |A|. After that he removes from C all non-lucky digits saving the order of the remaining (lucky) digits. So C now becomes a lucky string. For example, if after reordering A = \"754\" and B = \"873\", then C is at first \"874\" and then it becomes \"74\".\n\n\nThe Little Elephant wants the resulting string to be as lucky as possible. The formal definition of this is that the resulting string should be the lexicographically greatest possible string among all the strings that can be obtained from the given strings A and B by the described process.\n\nNotes\n\n|A| denotes the length of the string A.\nA[i] denotes the i-th digit of the string A. Here we numerate the digits starting from 1. So 1 \u2264 i \u2264 |A|.\nThe string A is called lexicographically greater than the string B if either there exists some index i such that A[i] > B[i] and for each j < i we have A[j] = B[j], or B is a proper prefix of A, that is, |A| > |B| and first |B| digits of A coincide with the corresponding digits of B.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains the string A. The second line contains the string B.\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case output a single line containing the answer for the corresponding test case. Note, that the answer can be an empty string. In this case you should print an empty line for the corresponding test case.\n\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 10000\n1 \u2264 |A| \u2264 20000\n|A| = |B|\nEach character of A and B is a digit.\nSum of |A| across all the tests in the input does not exceed 200000.\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n4\n4\n7\n435\n479\n7\n8\n1675475\n9756417\n\nOutput:\n7\n74\n\n777744\n\n\nExplanation\n\nCase 1. In this case the only possible string C we can get is \"7\" and it is the lucky string.\n\n\nCase 2. If we reorder A and B as A = \"543\" and B = \"749\" the string C will be at first \"749\" and then becomes \"74\". It can be shown that this is the lexicographically greatest string for the given A and B.\n\n\nCase 3. In this case the only possible string C we can get is \"8\" and it becomes and empty string after removing of non-lucky digits.\n\n\nCase 4. If we reorder A and B as A = \"7765541\" and B = \"5697714\" the string C will be at first \"7797744\" and then becomes \"777744\". Note that we can construct any lexicographically greater string for the given A and B since we have only four \"sevens\" and two \"fours\" among digits of both strings A and B as well the constructed string \"777744\".\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

Digory's Uncle Andrew has been secretly doing strange things in the attic of his house, and he always ensures that the room is locked. Being curious, Digory suspects that there is another route into the attic through Polly's house, and being curious as kids always are, they wish to find out what it is that Uncle Andrew is secretly up to.\n\n\nSo they start from Polly's house, and walk along the passageway to Digory's. Unfortunately, along the way, they suddenly find that some of the floorboards are missing, and that taking a step forward would have them plummet to their deaths below.\n\n\nDejected, but determined, they return to Polly's house, and decide to practice long-jumping in the yard before they re-attempt the crossing of the passage. It takes them exactly one day to master long-jumping a certain length. Also, once they have mastered jumping a particular length L, they are able to jump any amount less than equal to L as well.\n\n\nThe next day they return to their mission, but somehow find that there is another place further up the passage, that requires them to jump even more than they had practiced for. So they go back and repeat the process.\n\n\nNote the following:\n\n At each point, they are able to sense only how much they need to jump at that point, and have no idea of the further reaches of the passage till they reach there. That is, they are able to only see how far ahead is the next floorboard. \n The amount they choose to practice for their jump is exactly the amount they need to get across that particular part of the passage. That is, if they can currently jump upto a length L0, and they require to jump a length L1(> L0) at that point, they will practice jumping length L1 that day. \n They start by being able to \"jump\" a length of 1. \n\n\nFind how many days it will take them to cross the passageway. In the input, the passageway is described as a string P of '#'s and '.'s. A '#' represents a floorboard, while a '.' represents the absence of a floorboard. The string, when read from left to right, describes the passage from Polly's house to Digory's, and not vice-versa.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line consists of a single integer T, the number of testcases.\nEach of the next T lines consist of the string P for that case.\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each case, output the number of days it takes them to cross the passage.\n\n\nConstraints\n\n 1  \u2264 T  \u2264 1,000,000  (10^6)\n 1  \u2264 |P|  \u2264 1,000,000 (10^6)\n The total length of P will be \u2264 5,000,000 (5 * 10^6)across all test-cases of a test-file \n P will consist of only the characters # and . \n The first and the last characters of P will be #. \n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n4\n####\n##.#..#\n##..#.#\n##.#....#\n\nOutput:\n0\n2\n1\n2\n\nExplanation\n\nFor the first example, they do not need to learn any jump size. They are able to cross the entire passage by \"jumping\" lengths 1-1-1.\n\n\nFor the second example case, they get stuck at the first '.', and take one day learning to jump length 2. When they come back the next day, they get stuck at '..' and take one day to learn to jump length 3.\n\n\nFor the third example case, they get stuck first at '..', and they take one day to learn to jump length 3. On the second day, they are able to jump both length 3 as well as length 2 required to cross the passage.\n\n\nFor the last test case they need to stop and learn jumping two times. At first they need to jump a length 2 and then a length 5.\n\n\nAppendix\n\nIrrelevant to the problem description, if you're curious about what Uncle Andrew was up to, he was experimenting on Magic Rings that could facilitate travel between worlds.

Rows are numbered 1 to N, from top to bottom. Columns are numbered 1 to M, from left to right. You are initially at cell (1, 1) and want to go to cell (N, M). From any cell you can move to the cell below it or to the cell right to it. You should never go out of the grid. At any point you should consider all the possibilities of movement with equal probability\nLet P[i][j] be the probability of visiting cell (i, j). You need to calculate the sum of P[i][j] for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 N, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 M.\nAs we all know, Tojo really hates probability related problems.

You always end up at (2, 2), so P[2][2] is 1.

If you have A dollars and B cents remaining in your purse after depositing the C cents, then after the transformation you will have B dollars and A cents. You can repeat this procedure as many times as you want unless you don't have enough money for the machine. If at any point C > B and A > 0, then the machine will allow you to break one of the A dollars into 100 cents so you can place C cents in the machine. The machine will not allow you to exchange a dollar for 100 cents if B >= C.\n \nOf course, you want to do this to maximize your profit. For example if C=69 and you have 9 dollars and 77 cents then after you put 69 cents in the machine you will have 8 dollars and 9 cents (9.77 --> 9.08 --> 8.09). But I should warn you that you can't cheat. If you try to throw away 9 cents before the transformation (in order to obtain 99 dollars and 8 cents after), the machine will sense you are cheating and take away all of your money. You need to know how many times you should do this transformation in order to make a maximum profit. Since you are very busy man, you want to obtain the maximum possible profit in the minimum amount of time.\n\n\nInput\n The first line contains a single integer T <= 40, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The only line of each test case contains three nonnegative integers A, B and C where A, B, C < 100. It means that you have A dollars and B cents in your purse and you need to put C cents in the machine to make the transformation.\n\n\nOutput\n For each test case, output a single line containing the minimal number of times you should do this transformation in order to make a maximal profit. It is guaranteed that the answer is less than 10000.\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n2\n9 77 69\n98 99 69\n\nOutput:\n4\n0\n\n\nExplanation\nIn the first test we have the following sequence: 9.77, 8.09, 40.07, 38.39, 70.37, 68.69, 0.68. After last step we have not enough money for further transformations. The maximal profit will be after 4 transformations.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

    "prompt": "### Prompt\nAn equation is an equality containing one or more variables. Solving the equation consists of determining which values of the variables make the equality true. In this situation, variables are also known as unknowns and the values which satisfy the equality are known as solutions. An equation differs from an identity in that an equation is not necessarily true for all possible values of the variable.\nThere are many types of equations, and they are found in all areas of mathematics. For instance, a linear equation is an algebraic equation in which each term is either a constant or the product of a constant and (the first power of) a single variable.\nIn this problem we'll consider quite a special kind of systems of linear equations. To be more specific, you are given a system of N linear equations of the following form:\n\nx2 + x3 + ... + xN - 1 + xN = a1\nx1 + x3 + ... + xN - 1 + xN = a2\n...\nx1 + x2 + ... + xN - 2 + xN = aN - 1\nx1 + x2 + ... + xN - 2 + xN - 1 = aN\n\nIn other words, i'th equation of the system consists of the sum of all the variable x1, ..., xN except xi to the left of the equality sign and the constant ai to the right of the equality sign.\nOne can easily prove, that a system of linear equations as described above always have exactly one solution in case N is greater than one. Your task is to find the solution of the system(such a sequence x1, x2, ..., xN, that turns each of the equations into equality). It's guaranteed, that the solution of the system is a sequence consisting only of integers from the range [1, 10^8].\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of the test case description contains one integer N denoting the number of equations in the system.\nThe second line contains N integers a1, a2, ..., aN denoting the constants defining a system of linear equations, that you are asked to solve.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing N integers: a sequence x1, x2, ..., xN, which is the solution of the system.\n\nConstraints\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 25000\n2 \u2264 N \u2264 50000\n1 \u2264 ai \u2264 5 \u00d7 10^12\n1 \u2264 xi \u2264 10^8\nThe sum of all N in the input is not greater than 50000\n\nExample\nInput:\n2\n3\n9 6 5\n4\n13 11 10 8\n\nOutput:\n1 4 5 \n1 3 4 6 \n\n\nExplanation\n\n\tIn the first test case, we can simply replace the variables with the values from the correct output to make sure, that all the conditions are satisfied: \n\nx2 + x3 = 4 + 5 = 9 = a1\nx1 + x3 = 1 + 5 = 6 = a2\nx1 + x2 = 1 + 4 = 5 = a3\n\n\n\tIn the second test case, we can repeat the same process to make sure, that all the conditions are satisfied: \n\nx2 + x3 + x4 = 3 + 4 + 6 = 13 = a1\nx1 + x3 + x4 = 1 + 4 + 6 = 11 = a2\nx1 + x2 + x4 = 1 + 3 + 6 = 10 = a3\nx1 + x2 + x3 = 1 + 3 + 4 = 8 = a4\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

So, he is going to experiment by pairing up some of his employees to see if the quality of the food prepared in his kitchen increases. However, only some pairs of employees are compatible. Two employees that are not compatible cannot be paired together.\n\n\nFor each pair of compatible employees, the Chef has assigned a number estimating how well the overall quality of the food might increase. Of course, each employee can only be paired with at most one other employee. Furthermore, it is ok to not pair some employees. So, your goal is to help the Chef decide how to pair the employees to maximize the total amount that the overall quality of food increases.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer denoting the number of test cases (at most 50). Each test case begins with two integers n and m. Here, n is the number of employees (between 2 and 1000) and m is the number of compatible pairs of employees (between 1 and 10,000). The employees are numbered from 0 to n-1. The next m lines describe a pair of compatible employees, one per line. The i'th such line contains two distinct integers ui,vi between 0 and n-1. Strangely enough, the Chef estimates that picking the i'th pair ui,vi will increase the quality of food prepared in his kitchen by exactly 2^i.\n\n\nNo pair of employees will be given more than once in the input. That is, for distinct indices i and j, we do not have both ui = uj and vi = vj, nor do we have both ui = vj and vi = uj.\n\n\nOutput\n\nThe output for each test case consists of the indices of the pairs of employees that are used in a maximum total value pairing (the indices are between 0 and m-1). These indices should be given in increasing order with a single space between consecutive numbers. If there is more than one possible output, then any will do.\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n2\n4 5\n0 1\n1 2\n2 3\n1 3\n3 0\n4 3\n0 1\n2 3\n2 1\n\nOutput:\n1 4\n2\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

However, since the sheets are very old, some letters have become unreadable.\nChef would like to estimate the difference between these strings. Let's assume that the first string is named S1, and the second S2. The unreadable symbols are specified with the question mark symbol '?'. The difference between the strings equals to the number of positions i, such that S1i is not equal to S2i, where S1i and S2i denote the symbol at the i the position in S1 and S2, respectively.\nChef would like to know the minimal and the maximal difference between the two strings, if he changes all unreadable symbols to lowercase Latin letters.

You can change the question marks in the strings so that you obtain S1 = abc and S2 = abb. Then S1 and S2 will differ in one position. On the other hand, you can change the letters so that S1 = abc and S2 = bab. Then, the strings will differ in all three positions.\nExample case 2. Change the question marks this way: S1 = dcba, S2 = dcba, then the strings will differ in 0 positions. You can also change the question marks so that S1 = aaaa, S2 = dcba, then the strings will differ in 3 positions.\nExample case 3. Change the question marks this way: S1 = aabac, S2 = abaaw, then the strings will differ in 3 positions.

In this situation, Chef can make them equal by giving 1 pack of 10 to Alvin and 2 packs of 3 to Berto, so they now have 1 + 10 = 5 + 3 + 3 = 11 candies each.\nExample case 2. In this test case, Alvin has 1 candy and Berto has 2. The apple and banana candies come in packs of 2. In this situation, the number of candies of Alvin is always odd, and the number of candies of Berto is always even, so Chef cannot make them equal.

For example, one can say that Chef Prime is son of daughter of sister of father of father of Chef Composite.\nYou are given R relations of form \"A is F of B\", for N people from the party. There variable F is one of the following strings: father, mother, son, daughter, brother, sister. Also you are given Q queries of Little Joe, each query has form \"X Y\". For each query output the distance between persons X and Y. Distance is equal to the minimal number of fundamental relations appearing while describing the relation between X and Y. For example distance between Chef Prime and Chef Composite is 5. \nImportant points:\n1. Here brother (or sister) relation is considered between children of same parents only. Hence cousins are not considered brother (or sister) .\n2. Given relations meet all the following conditions:\n\nEach person has an unique name, and each name appears in at least one relation (as A, or as B).\nNo name appears more than once as the first part of relation (as A).\nThere is no cyclic relations. For example, the following relations cannot appear simultaneously in some testcase \"A is F1 of B\", \"B is F2 of C\" and \"C is F3 of A\".\n\n3. One can have at most one father and at most one mother. And in Chef's land no one takes divorce!\n4. Since you should calculate the minimal fundamental relations between some persons, you need to make some conclusion. For example, if X is father of Y, and Y is brother of Z, then X is father of Z.\n\nInput\nThe first line contains two integers N, number of people, and R, number of relations. Then R lines follow. Each line contains a relation of form \"A is F of B\".\nThe next line contains integer Q, number of queries. Each of the next Q lines contains two space-separated strings X and Y, denoting the query of the Little Joe. X and Y are guaranteed to be valid names mentioned above in relations.\n\nOutput\nOutput Q lines each containing distance for i^th query. Print '-1' (without quotes) if X and Y are not related in any manner.\n\nConstraints\n\n2 \u2264 N \u2264 256\n1 \u2264 R < N\n1 \u2264 Q \u2264 16384\n1 \u2264 Length of string A, B, X, Y \u2264 4\nA \u2260 B\nX \u2260 Y\nInput relations are correct in terms of gender.\nEach name consists of lower case alphabets (\"a-z\") only.\n\n\nExample\nInput:\n8 7\ntom is brother of ron\nron is brother of john\njohn is father of kel\nkel is son of cloe\ncloe is sister of ru\nanne is daughter of cloe\nru is mother of fred\n5\nkel john\nron kel\njohn ru\njohn kel\njohn anne\n\nOutput:\n1\n2\n3\n1\n1\n\u00a0\n\nExplanation\nConsider the first query: kel is son of john, so the distance = 1\nConsider the second query: ron is brother of father of kel, so the distance = 2\nConsider the third query: john is father of son of sister of ru, so the distance = 3. Note that relation between john and ru can also be expressed as john is father of daughter of sister of ru\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

XOR A[N]) is defined as A[1] XOR (A[2] XOR (A[3] XOR ( ... XOR A[N]))).\nHe has an array A consisting of N integers. Index in the array are numbered from 1 to N, inclusive. Let us denote by F(L, R), the XOR-sum of all integers in the array A whose indices lie from L to R, inclusive, i.e. F(L, R) = A[L] XOR A[L+1] XOR ... XOR A[R]. Your task is to find the total sum of XOR-sums F(L, R) over all L and R such that 1 \u2264 L \u2264 R \u2264 N.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.

First, the shorter number is prepended with leading zeroes until the numbers have equal size in binary. Then the resulting number (also in binary) contains 0 in all positions where the corresponding bits coincide, and 1 on the rest of the positions.\n For example, 3 XOR 5 = 0112 XOR 1012 = 1102 = 6.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

Magician Cyael is one such magician.\nCyael has been having some issues with her last performances and today she\u2019ll have to perform for an audience of some judges, who will change her tournament ranking, possibly increasing it. As she is a great magician she managed to gather a description of the fixed judges\u2019 disposition on the room (which is represented as an N \u00d7 N square matrix), such that she knows in advance the fixed points each judge will provide. She also knows that the room is divided into several parallel corridors, such that we will denote the j-th cell on corridor i, as [i][j]. Note that some judges can award Cyael, zero points or negative points, as they are never pleased with her performance.\nThere is just one judge at each cell of the matrix, except the cells [1][1] and [N][N].\nTo complete her evaluation, she must start on the top leftmost corner of the room (cell [1][1]), and finish on the bottom right corner (cell [N][N]), moving either to the cell directly in front of her on the same corridor (that is, moving from cell [r][c] to cell [r][c+1], where c+1 \u2264 N) or to the cell in the next corridor directly in front of where she is (that is, moving from cell [r][c] to cell [r+1][c], where r+1 \u2264 N). She will keep doing this until she reaches the end point of the room, i.e. last cell [N][N] on the last corridor.

A lot of boys were dreaming of becoming a knight, while a lot of girls were dreaming of marrying a knight on a white horse.\n\nIn this problem we consider one of these tournaments.\n\n\nLet's us call a tournament binary, if it runs according to the scheme described below:\n\n\nExactly N knights take part in the tournament, N^K for some integer K > 0.\nEach knight has a unique skill called strength, described as an integer from the interval [1, N].\nInitially, all the knights are standing in a line, waiting for a battle. Since all their strengths are unique, each initial configuration can be described as a permutation of numbers from 1 to N.\nThere are exactly K rounds in the tournament, 2^K - i + 1 knights take part in the i'th round. The K'th round is called the final.\nThe i'th round runs in the following way: for each positive integer j \u2264 2^K - i happens a battle between a knight on the 2\u2219j'th position and a knight on the 2\u2219j+1'th position. The strongest of two continues his tournament, taking the j'th position on the next round, while the weakest of two is forced to leave.\nThe only knight, who has won K rounds, is the winner. The only knight, who has won K - 1 rounds, but lost the final, is the runner-up.\n\t\n\nAs you can see from the scheme, the winner is always the same, an initial configuration doesn't change anything. So, your task is to determine chances of each knight to appear in the final.\n\n\nFormally, for each knight you need to count the number of initial configurations, which will lead him to the final. Since the number can be extremly huge, you are asked to do all the calculations under modulo 10^9 + 9.\n\n\nInput\nThe first line contains the only integer K, denoting the number of rounds of the tournament.\n\u00a0\n\nOutput\nOutput should consist of 2^K lines.

The Chef is a Game Master, so his concern is how to manage the game but not how to win the game like his assistants do.\n\n\nThe game requires players to find the only ball under one of the N cups after their positions are changed in a special way. At the beginning of the game, The Chef places N cups in a row and put a ball under the C-th cup from the left (the cups are numbered from 1 to N). All players can see the initial position of the ball. Then Chef performs Q flip operations. Each flip operation is defined by two integers L and R such that 1 \u2264 L \u2264 R \u2264 N and consists in reversing the segment [L, R] of cups. Namely, Chef swaps L-th and R-th cups, (L+1)-th and (R\u22121)-th cups, and so on. After performing all the operations Chef asks his assistants to choose a cup that they think the ball is under it. Who can guess the position of the ball will win the game, and of course, the others will have to clean the kitchen.\n\n\nThe Chef doesn't want to check all the N cups at the end of the game. He notes down the value of C and the pairs (L, R) and asked you, the mastered programmer, to determine the cup that contains the ball.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, C and Q, denoting the total number of cups, the initial position of the ball and the number of flip operations Chef will perform. Each of the following Q lines contains two space-separated integers L and R, denoting the ends of the segment of the current flip operation.\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case output on a separate line the final position of the ball.\n\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 10\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 100000 (10^5)\n1 \u2264 C \u2264 N\n1 \u2264 Q \u2264 10000 (10^4)\n1 \u2264 L \u2264 R \u2264 N\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n1\n5 2 3\n1 4\n3 5\n1 5\n\nOutput:\n1\n\nExplanation\n\nThe row of cups at the beginning of the game and after each flip is shown below.

Po offers dragon food to master Shifu, who is a famous cook in the valley of food. In return, Shifu hands over the dragon scroll to Po, which is said to hold the ingredients of the secret recipe. To open the dragon scroll, one has to solve the following puzzle. \n1. Consider a N-bit integer A. We call an integer A' as shuffle-A, if A' can be obtained by shuffling the bits of A in its binary representation. For eg. if N = 5 and A = 6 = (00110)2,  A' can be any 5-bit integer having exactly two 1s in it i.e., any of (00011)2, (00101)2, (00110)2, (01010)2, ...., (11000)2.\n2. Given two N-bit integers A and B, find the maximum possible value of (A' xor B') where A' is a shuffle-A, B' is a shuffle-B and xor is the bit-wise xor operator.\nGiven N, A and B, please help Po in opening the dragon scroll.\nNotes\n1. xor operator takes two bit strings of equal length and performs the logical XOR operation on each pair of corresponding bits. The result in each position is 1 if only the first bit is 1 OR only the second bit is 1, but will be 0 if both are 1 or both are 0. For eg: 5 (0101) xor 3(0011) = 6(0110). In most languages it is represented using ^ symbol. 5 ^ 3 = 6.\n2. If the integer actually needs less than N bits to represent in binary, append sufficient number of leading 0 bits. For eg. as shown in the problem statement for N = 5, A = 6 = (00110)2\n\nInput\nFirst line contains an integer T ( number of test cases, around 100 ). T cases follow, each having N A B in a single line, separated by a space. ( 1 <= N <= 30, 0 <= A,B < 2^N )\n\n\nOutput\nFor each case, output the maximum possible value of (shuffle-A xor shuffle-B) in a separate line.\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n3\n3 5 4\n5 0 1\n4 3 7\n\n\nOutput:\n7\n16\n14\n\n\nExplanation:\n\nCase 1: 5 and 4 as 3-bit binary strings are (101)2 and (100)2 respectively. After shuffling, xor can be maximum for (110)2 ^ (001)2 = (111)2 = 7\nCase 2: Maximum Possible result can be for (00000)2 ^ (10000)2 = (10000)2 = 16\nCase 3: Maximum Possible result can be for (0011)2 ^ (1101)2 = (1110)2 = 14\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

Each point p is defined by it's two integer coordinates \u2014 px and py. The distance between points a and b is min(|ax - bx|, |ay - by|). You should choose a starting point and make a route visiting every point exactly once, i.e. if we write down numbers of points in order you visit them we should obtain a permutation. Of course, overall distance walked should be as small as possible. The number of points may be up to 40.\n\n\"40? Maybe 20? Are you kidding?\" \u2013 asked Roman. \"No, it's not a joke\" \u2013 replied Vadim. So Roman had nothing to do, but try to solve this problem. Since Roman is really weak in problem solving and you are the only friend, except Vadim, with whom Roman can discuss challenging tasks, he has nobody else to ask for help, but you!\n\n\nInput\nInput description.\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.

The answer for every test case is a permutation of length N. In case there are several solutions that lead to minimal distance walked, you should choose the lexicographically smallest one.

    "prompt": "### Prompt\nAs every other little boy, Mike has a favorite toy to play with. Mike's favorite toy is a set of N disks. The boy likes to compose his disks in stacks, but there's one very important rule: the disks in a single stack must be ordered by their radiuses in a strictly increasing order such that the top-most disk will have the smallest radius.\n\n\nFor example, a stack of disks with radii (5, 2, 1) is valid, while a stack of disks with radii (3, 4, 1) is not.\n\n\nLittle Mike has recently come up with the following algorithm after the order of disks are given:\n\n\nFirst, Mike initiates an empty set of disk stacks.\nThen, Mike processes the disks in the chosen order using the following pattern:\n\nIf there is at least one stack such that Mike can put the current disk on the top of the stack without making it invalid, then he chooses the stack with the smallest top disk radius strictly greater than the radius of the current disk, and puts the current disk on top of that stack.\nOtherwise, Mike makes a new stack containing only the current disk.\n\t\n\n\nFor example, let's assume that the order of the disk radii is (3, 4, 5, 1, 1, 2). Here's how the set of the top stack disks will appear during the algorithm's run:\n\n\nIn the beginning of the algorithm, the set of disk stacks is empty. After processing the first disk, the set of top stack disks is {3}.\nWe cannot put the second disk on the only stack that we have after processing the first disk, so we make a new stack. After processing the second disk, the set of top stack disks is {3, 4}.\nWe cannot put the third disk on any of the available stacks, so we make a new stack. After processing the third disk, the set of top stack disks is {3, 4, 5}.\nThe fourth disk has radius 1, so it can be easily put on any of the available stacks. According to the algorithm, we choose the stack with the top disk radius equal to 3. After processing the fourth disk, the set of top stack disks is {1, 4, 5}.\nThe fifth disk has radius 1, so there are two stacks we can put it on. According to the algorithm, we choose the stack with the top disk radius equal to 4. After processing the fifth disk, the set of top stack disks is {1, 1, 5}.\nThe sixth disk has radius 2, so there is only one stack we can put it on. The final set of top stack disks is {1, 1, 2}.\n\n\nMike is really excited about his new algorithm, but he has so many disks that it seems impossible to simulate the algorithm manually.\n\n\nYou are given an array A of N integers denoting the radii of Mike's disks. The disks are already ordered by Mike. Your task is to find the set of the stack top disk radii after the algorithm is done.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\n\n\nThe first line of a test description contains a single integer N.\n\n\nThe second line of the description contains N integers denoting A1, ... , AN.\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single line. The line should start with a positive integer S denoting the number of stacks after the algorithm is done. This should be followed by S integers on the same line denoting the stacks' top disk radii in non-decreasing order.\n\n\nIf there are multiple correct answers, you are allowed to output any of them.\n\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 10\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 10^5\n1 \u2264 Ai \u2264 10^9\n\n\nExample\nInput:\n3\n6\n3 4 5 1 1 2\n10\n3 2 9 5 2 9 4 14 7 10\n8\n14 5 13 19 17 10 18 12\n\nOutput:\n3 1 1 2\n5 2 2 4 7 10 \n4 5 10 12 18 \n\nExplanation\nExample 1 is already explained in the problem statement.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

From now on, he decided to paint 1D pictures only.\nChef's canvas is N millimeters long and is initially all white. For simplicity, colors will be represented by an integer between 0 and 10^5. 0 indicates white. The picture he is envisioning is also N millimeters long and the i^th millimeter consists purely of the color Ci. Unfortunately, his brush isn't fine enough to paint every millimeter one by one. The brush is 3 millimeters wide and so it can only paint three millimeters at a time with the same color. Painting over the same place completely replaces the color by the new one. Also, Chef has lots of bottles of paints of each color, so he will never run out of paint of any color.\nChef also doesn't want to ruin the edges of the canvas, so he doesn't want to paint any part beyond the painting. This means, for example, Chef cannot paint just the first millimeter of the canvas, or just the last two millimeters, etc.\nHelp Chef by telling him whether he can finish the painting or not with these restrictions.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.

Chef's canvas initially contains the colors [0,0,0,0]. Chef can finish the painting by first painting the first three millimeters with color 1, so the colors become [1,1,1,0], and then the last three millimeters with color 5 so that it becomes [1,5,5,5].\nExample case 2. Chef's canvas initially contains the colors [0,0,0,0]. Chef can finish the painting by first painting the last three millimeters by color 5 so the colors become [0,5,5,5], and then the first three millimeters by color 1 so it becomes [1,1,1,5].\nExample case 3.

Also, the same processes cannot be aplied twice in succession. For example, heating \u2192 baking \u2192 heating is allowed, but heating \u2192 heating \u2192 baking is not allowed because 'heating' comes twice in succession.\n\nAny given sequence A1, A2, A3, ...

He also gives the formula for calculating the number of different objects with rang N as following:\nthe number of different objects with rang N = F(N) = A0 + A1 * N + A2 * N^2 + A3 * N^3.\nNow Chef wants to know how many different multisets of these objects exist such that sum of rangs of the objects in the multiset equals to S. You are given the coefficients in F(N) and the target sum S. Please, find the number of different multisets modulo 1,000,000,007.\nYou should consider a multiset as an unordered sequence of integers. Two multisets are different if and only if there at least exists one element which occurs X times in the first multiset but Y times in the second one, where (X \u2260 Y).\n\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. \nThe first line of each test case contains four integers A0, A1, A2, A3. The second line contains an integer S.\n\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing a single integer - the answer to the test case modulo 1,000,000,007.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 500\n1 \u2264 S \u2264 100\n0 \u2264 Ai \u2264 1000\nSum of all S for all test cases is not greater than 500. It's guaranteed that at least one Ai is non-zero.\n\n\nExample\nInput:\n4\n1 0 0 0\n1\n1 0 0 0\n3\n0 1 0 0\n2\n2 3 1 4\n10\n\nOutput:\n1\n3\n3\n213986343\n\nExplanation\nExample case 2. \nIn the second example function looks as follows F(N) = 1. So for each rang there is a single object of the rang. To get multiset with sum of rangs equal to 3, you can pick: three objects of rang 1, or one object of rang 1 and one of rang 2, or only one object of rang 3. \nExample case 3. \nIn the third example function looks as follows F(N) = N. So, you have one distinct object of rang 1, two distinct objects of rang 2, three distinct objects of rang 3 and so on. To get\nmultiset with sum of rangs equal to 2, you can pick: two objects of rang 1, one of objects of rang 2 (two ways).\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

These transceivers form the areas called cells (this term gave the name to the cellular phone) and every phone connects to the BTS with the strongest signal (in a little simplified view). Of course, BTSes need some attention and technicians need to check their function periodically.\n\nThe technicians faced a very interesting problem recently. Given a set of BTSes to visit, they needed to find the shortest path to visit all of the given points and return back to the central company building. Programmers have spent several months studying this problem but with no results. They were unable to find the solution fast enough. After a long time, one of the programmers found this problem in a conference article. Unfortunately, he found that the problem is so called \"Traveling Salesman Problem\" and it is very hard to solve. If we have N BTSes to be visited, we can visit them in any order, giving us N! possibilities to examine. The function expressing that number is called factorial and can be computed as a product\n\n1.2.3.4....N. The number is very high even for a relatively small N.\nThe programmers understood they had no chance to solve the problem. But because they have already received the research grant from the government, they needed to continue with their studies and produce at least some results. So they started to study behavior of the factorial function.\nFor example, they defined the function Z. For any positive integer N, Z(N) is the number of zeros at the end of the decimal form of number N!. They noticed that this function never decreases. If we have two numbers N1<N2, then  Z(N1) <= Z(N2). It is because we can never \"lose\" any\ntrailing zero by multiplying by any positive number. We can only get new and new zeros. The function Z is very interesting, so we need a computer program that can determine its value efficiently.\n\nInput\nThere is a single positive integer T on the first line of input (equal to about 100000). It stands for the number of numbers to follow. Then there are T lines, each containing exactly one positive integer number N, 1 <= N <= 1000000000.\n\nOutput\nFor every number N, output a single line containing the single non-negative integer Z(N).\n\nExample\nSample Input:\n\n6\n3\n60\n100\n1024\n23456\n8735373\n\nSample Output:\n\n0\n14\n24\n253\n5861\n2183837\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

But unfortunately, he got injured during a game a few months back and has been out of play ever since.\nHe's got proper treatment and is eager to go out and play for his team again. Before doing that, he has to prove to his fitness to the coach and manager of the team. Rayne has been playing practice matches for the past few days. He's played N practice matches in all.\nHe wants to convince the coach and the manager that he's improved over time and that his injury no longer affects his game. To increase his chances of getting back into the team, he's decided to show them stats of any 2 of his practice games. The coach and manager will look into the goals scored in both the games and see how much he's improved. If the number of goals scored in the 2nd game(the game which took place later) is greater than that in 1st, then he has a chance of getting in. Tell Rayne what is the maximum improvement in terms of goal difference that he can show to maximize his chances of getting into the team. If he hasn't improved over time, he's not fit to play. Scoring equal number of goals in 2 matches will not be considered an improvement. Also, he will be declared unfit if he doesn't have enough matches to show an improvement.\n\nInput:\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T, the number of test cases.\nEach test case begins with a single integer N, the number of practice matches Rayne has played.\nThe next line contains N integers. The ith integer, gi, on this line represents the number of goals Rayne scored in his ith practice match. The matches are given in chronological order i.e. j > i means match number j took place after match number i.\n\n\nOutput:\nFor each test case output a single line containing the maximum goal difference that Rayne can show to his coach and manager. If he's not fit yet, print \"UNFIT\".\n\n\nConstraints:\n1<=T<=10\n1<=N<=100000\n0<=gi<=1000000 (Well, Rayne's a legend! You can expect him to score so many goals!)\n\n\nExample:\nInput:\n3\n6\n3 7 1 4 2 4\n5\n5 4 3 2 1\n5\n4 3 2 2 3\n\nOutput:\n4\nUNFIT\n1\n\nExplanation:\nIn the first test case, Rayne can choose the first and second game. Thus he gets a difference of 7-3=4 goals. Any other pair would give him a lower improvement.\nIn the second test case, Rayne has not been improving in any match. Thus he's declared UNFIT.\nNote: Large input data. Use faster I/O methods. Prefer scanf,printf over cin/cout.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

Here N = 1, so we have no pairs (i; j) with 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 N. So the number of inversions is equal to zero. The number of local inversion is also equal to zero. Hence this permutation is good.\n\n\nCase 2. Here N = 2, and we have one pair (i; j) with 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 N, the pair (1; 2). Since A[1] = 2 and A[2] = 1 then A[1] > A[2] and the number of inversions is equal to 1. The number of local inversion is also equal to 1 since we have one value of i for which 1 \u2264 i < N (the value i = 1) and A[i] > A[i+1] for this value of i since A[1] > A[2]. Hence this permutation is also good.\n\n\nCase 3. Here N = 3, and we have three pairs (i; j) with 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 N. We have A[1] = 3, A[2] = 2, A[3] = 1. Hence A[1] > A[2], A[1] > A[3] and A[2] > A[3]. So the number of inversions is equal to 3. To count the number of local inversion we should examine inequalities A[1] > A[2] and A[2] > A[3]. They both are satisfied in our case, so we have 2 local inversions. Since 2 \u2260 3 this permutations is not good.\n\n\nCase 4. Here we have only one inversion and it comes from the pair (2; 3) since A[2] = 3 > 2 = A[3]. This pair gives also the only local inversion in this permutation. Hence the number of inversions equals to the number of local inversions and equals to one. So this permutation is good.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

But the Chef wants to watch the season finale of MasterChef which will be aired at the same time. Now they don't want to fight over it like they used to when they were little kids. They want to decide it in a fair way. So they agree to play a game to make a decision. Their favourite childhood game!\nThe game consists of C boards. Each board i is a grid of dimension ni x mi.\n\nRules of the game:\n- A coin is placed at (1,1) on every board initially.\n- Each one takes a turn alternatively.\n- In one turn, a player can choose any one board and move a coin from a cell (i,j) to one of the following cells:\n\t(i+1,j) OR (i+2,j) OR (i,j+1) OR (i,j+2) OR (i+1,j+1) OR (i+2,j+2).\n- A coin cannot be moved out of the board at any point during the game.\n- A coin cannot be moved once it reaches the cell (n,m) where n and m are the dimensions of the board of that coin.\n- A player MUST make one valid move.\n- The player who makes the last move gets to watch TV.\n\nBoth of them are passionate about their interests and want to watch their respective shows. So they will obviously make optimal moves in every turn. The Chef, being the elder brother, takes the first turn.\nYour task is to predict which show they will be watching tonight.\n\nInput:\nThe first line of input contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. T tests follow.Each test case starts with a single line containing C, the number of boards in the game.\nThen follow C lines: each containing 2 integers ni and mi, the dimensions of the ith board.\n\nOutput:\nGiven the number and dimensions of boards, for each test case, output in a single line: \"MasterChef\" if the Chef wins or \"Football\" if his brother wins.\n\nConstraints:\n1<=T<=10000\n1<=C<=20\n2<=ni,mi<=1000\n\n\nExample:\nInput:\n1\n1\n2 2\nOutput:\nMasterChef\nExplanation: \nThe Chef can move the coin on the board from (1,1)->(2,2). This coin cannot be moved any further. And so, the Chef wins.\nNotice that if the Chef moves it to any other valid position, i.e. either to (1,2) or (2,1) he will lose!\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

The safest way from Chef's town to Byteland is through the path of tasty dishes. The path is named so because there are magical tasty dishes which appear to the traveler that no one can resist eating. Also, Suraj has added a strong sleep potion to each of the dish on this path to stop anyone from following him.\nKnowing the devilish nature of Suraj, Ashi is concerned about the Chef and has asked all of Chef's town people to help. The distance from Chef's town to Byteland through the the path of tasty dishes is X units. They have the location where the magic dishes are and how many people are required to eat it completely. Anyone who eats a dish would go to a long sleep and won't be able to continue. They have the information about the tribal clans that live along the the path of tasty dishes who can be of real help in this journey. \nThe journey Chef and his friends can be described as follows: There is a total of B dishes on the path of tasty dishes. Each dish is located at some distance from Chef's town denoted by xi for the i^th dish ( xi-1 <  xi). To minimize the number of friends Chef has to leave behind, all of them have decided that exactly yi of them will eat the i^th dish, which is the required number of people needed to finish it completely. Also, there are a total of C tribal chef clans, each with their own population and location on the path that Chef and his friends will meet on their way to Byteland. They know that for some clan (say i), they are located at a distance of pi ( pi-1 <  pi) from Chef's town with a population of ri. And if a group of at least qi men approaches them, they would be able to convince them to join their forces against Suraj.\nGiven the information about all this, help the Chef to find out the minimum size of the group (including him and his friends) he should start with to reach Byteland and get back Ashi's gift from Suraj.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each test case contains three lines which are as follows:\nFirst line of each test case contains X, the distance of Byteland from Chef's town.\nNext line contains an integer B, the number of dishes on the path of tasty dishes. Then follows B pairs of space separated integers of the form xi yi, where xi yi are as defined above for the i^th dish.\nNext line contains an integer C, followed C space separated triplets of integers pi qi ri as defined above.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print the minimum size of the group  (including Chef) that is needed to reach Byteland.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 10\n1 \u2264 X \u2264 10^9\n1 \u2264 B \u2264 10000\n Constraints on C\n\nSubproblem 1 (25 points):  C = 0\nSubproblem 2 (75 points): 1 \u2264 C \u2264 10000\n\n\n1 \u2264 xi < X, xi < xi+1\n1 \u2264 pi < X, pi < pi+1\n1 \u2264 yi \u2264 10^14\n1 \u2264 qi \u2264 10^14\n1 \u2264 ri \u2264 10^14\nAll the positions, of the tasty dishes and tribal clans are distinct.\n\n\nExample\nInput:\n3\n10\n2 1 3 8 1\n0\n10\n2 1 3 8 5\n0\n10\n2 2 3 8 5\n3 1 2 1 4 3 2 9 1 1 \n\nOutput:\n5\n9\n6\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1. In the first case, there are no tribal clans, and two dishes, one which needs to be eaten by 3 chefs on their way and one to be eaten by 1 chef. Hence, we have to start with atleast 5 people in total to pass the path of tasty dishes.\nExample case 2. Similar as Example Case 1.\nExample case 3. In this case, if we start with 5 Chefs. At point 1, we have more than or equal to 2 chefs, hence the tribal clan of size 1 adds to the Chef's party and now they have size of 6. At position 2, three of them would be left behind eating a dish, leaving 3 of them to go ahead. At position 4, since the size is exactly 3, the tribal clan joins the chef's party making it of size 5. At position 8, all 5 of them will stop to eat the dish and none would go ahead. Similarly, if we start with 6, one of them would be able to pass position 8 and reach position 9, where it will also add one of the tribal clans to its party and reach Byteland.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

He even looted his own people, by using the following unfair strategy:\nThere are N houses in Maahishmati, and the i^th house has Ai gold plates. Each gold plate costs exactly 1 Nimbda, which is the unit of currency in the kingdom of Maahishmati. Bhallaladeva would choose an integer K, and loots all the houses in several steps. In each step:\n\nHe would choose a house i which hasn't been looted yet, pay the owner exactly Ai Nimbdas, and take away all the gold plates in that house (Hence, he also ends up looting this house).\nHe would now choose atmost K houses which haven't been looted yet and take away all the gold plates from these houses without paying a single Nimbda (Yes, he takes all of them for free).\n\n\nHe repeats the above steps until all the N houses have been looted. Your task is to devise a strategy for Bhallaladeva to loot the houses in some order, so that the number of nimbdas he has to pay is minimium. You'll also be given multiple values of K (Q of them to be precise), and you need to find the minimum number of nimbdas for each of these values.\n\nInput\nThe first line of input consists of a single integer N denoting the number of houses in Maahishmati.

Hence, Bhallaladeva cannot take gold plates from any of the houses for free. It will cost him 3 + 2 + 1 + 4 = 10 nimbdas.\nFor the second query, K = 2. In the first step Bhallaladeva can pay 2 nimbdas for gold plates in house number 2, and take the gold in houses 1 and 4 for free (Note that house 1 has 3 gold plates and house 4 has 4 gold plates). Now, he has looted houses 1, 2 & 4. Now in the second step, he loots house 3, by paying 1 nimbda. Hence, the total cost = 1 + 2 = 3.

To make problems even more challenging, he decided to measure allocated memory in a different way. Now judge program will be calculating not the maximum memory usage during the execution of all test files, but all the memory ever allocated by the solution program. But as Chef is not that good in algorithms, so he asks you to write a program that will calculate total memory usage of a solution.\nSo, you are given N numbers M1, , ,MN representing the measurements of consumed memory (in MBs) for N test files. In other terms, it means that on i-th test file, program took Mi MBs of memory. Initially, there is no memory allocated for your program. Before running your program on each test file, if the currently allocated memory is more than memory needed for the current test file, then there will be a deallocation of the memory to fit the current program. Also, if there is less than needed memory available, then allocation of memory will happen so as to fit the current program. e.g. Let us say that our program took 10 MBs on current test file. So, assuming if there was 12 MBs memory allocated before running the program on current test file, then there will happen a deallocation of 2 MBs. Assuming if there was 8 MBs memory allocated before running the program on current test file, then there will happen a allocation of 2 MBs.\n\n\nCalculate the total memory allocated for running the solution program on all the N test files. Please see third sample for more clarity.\n\nInput\nFirst line of input contains a single integer T denoting the  number of test cases. First line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of measurements. Second line of each test case contains N space separated integers, where i^th integer denotes the consumption of memory for i^th i-th test file.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print total memory allocated for running the solution program.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 10^5\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 10^5\n1 \u2264 Mi \u2264 10^9\n sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 10^5\n\n\nExample\nInput:\n3\n2\n1 1\n5\n1 2 3 4 5\n3\n1 3 2\n\nOutput:\n1\n5\n3\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1. Initially, there was no memory allocated. For running first test file, there was a memory allocation of 1 MBs. There was no allocation/ deallocation for running your program on second test file. \nExample case 2. On running on each test file, there was a further allocation of 1 MBs from previous one. So, there are total 5 MBs of memory allocated while running the program.\nExample case 3. Initially, there was no memory allocated. For running first test file, there was a memory allocation of 1 MBs. For running second test file, there was a further memory allocation of 2 MBs to have 3 MBs of memory needed, then in the last file, there was a deallocation of 1 MB of memory so as to get 2 MBs of memory needed for running the program. So, overall, there was 1 + 2 = 3 MBs of memory ever allocated in the program. Note that we are only counting allocated memory, not allocated + unallocated.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

Let's assume, that Mike can solve any X problems before the contest.\n\n\nDo you know what makes Mike happy? Right! Successful packages! A package of tasks is successful, if Mike solved all the tasks in it.\n\n\nDo you also know what makes Mike sad? Right! Failed packages! A package of tasks is failed, if Mike solved less than a half of the tasks in it.\n\n\nPlease, help Mike to organize his training session!\n\n\nMike wants to minimize the number of failed packages. If there are several ways of doing this, he wants to maximize the number of successful packages. Remember also that he can't solve more than X tasks before the contest.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contain two integers N and X.\nThe second line contain N positive integers, i'th integer denotes Ai. The array A is 1-indexed.\n\n\nOutput\nThe first line should contain two integers: the number of failed packages and the number of successful packages in the optimal way of solving.\n\nExample\nInput:\n3 10\n3 4 5\nOutput:\n0 2\n\n\nExplanation\n\nIn the test case N equals to 3, X equals to 10, A equals to {3, 4, 5}. It is optimal to solve all the problems in the first and the second packages and to solve 3 problems in the third package.\n\n\nScoring\n\n0 \u2264 X \u2264 10^15 for each test case;\n1 \u2264 Ai \u2264 10^9 for each test case.\n\n\nSubtask 1 (10 points): 1 \u2264 N \u2264 100, A1 + A2 + ... + AN \u2264 X;\nSubtask 2 (21 point): 1 \u2264 N \u2264 15;\nSubtask 3 (29 points): 1 \u2264 N \u2264 1000;\nSubtask 4 (25 points): 1 \u2264 N \u2264 100 000;\nSubtask 5 (15 points): 1 \u2264 N \u2264 1 000 000.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

Mahesh loved the array so much that he started to spend a lot of time on it everyday. One day, he wrote down all possible subsets of the array. Then for each subset, he calculated the sum of elements in that subset and wrote it down on a paper. Unfortunately, Mahesh lost the beautiful array :(.
