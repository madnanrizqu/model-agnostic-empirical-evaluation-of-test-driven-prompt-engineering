Mr.Ping makes the best noodle soup and his son Po is eagerly waiting for the user reviews in his father's blog. Users can vote with a (+) or a (-) and accordingly +1 or -1 is added to the total score respectively. Note that if a user votes multiple times, only his/her latest vote is counted towards the total score.\nPo opens the blog to see initial score of 0. To see the updated score without refreshing the page, he has to keep voting himself. After each of Po's clicks on (+) or (-), he can see the current total score, of course that considers Po's vote too. He is wondering how many users other than him could have possibly voted. Given the sequence of clicks made by Po and the total score displayed just after each of his clicks, can you tell him the minimum number of users that could have possibly voted at least once, other than Po.\n\n\nInput\nThere are multiple test cases ( at most 21 ). Each case starts with an integer N ( 1 <= N <= 1000 ), the number of Po's clicks. Sequence of N clicks follows, one on each line of the form \"vote score\" (without quotes, separated by a space), where vote is either a 'P' or a 'M', representing Plus(+) and Minus(-) respectively, the one clicked by Po and score is the score displayed after Po's click ( -1,000,000,000 <= score <= 1,000,000,000 ). The last case has N = 0 and should not be processed. Each case is followed by an empty line.\n\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output the minimum number of users that could have possibly voted at least once.\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n2\nP 1\nP 2\n\n2\nP 2\nM -2\n\n0\n\nOutput:\n1\n1\n\n\nExplanation:\nCase 1 :\nP 1 , Po voted (+) and score = 1 is possibly Po's vote itself.\nP 2 , Po again voted (+), but as only latest vote of a user is counted, Po contributed only +1 to the score, so possibly one more user voted with a (+). Remember that we have to find the number of users other than Po, so answer is 1\n\nCase 2 :\nP 2 , Po voted (+) and score = 2, possibly another user A also voted (+)\nM -2 , Po voted (-) and score = -2. Possibly the same user A also voted (-)\nSo there can possibly be just one other user A\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

Note that the game was invented by a twisted mind, and so a case where Wi \u2265 Wi + 1 for some 0 \u2264 i \u2264 N \u2212 1 is possible.\nChef is interested in finding the maximum possible winnings that he can amass.\n\nInput\nThe first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The  description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of questions.\nNext line contains N capital Latin letters denoting the correct answers to these questions.\nNext line contains N capital Latin letters denoting answers given by Chef to these questions.\nNext line contains N + 1 space-separated integers W0, W1, ..., WN denoting the winnings for 0, 1, ..., N correct answers.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the value of maximum possible winnings that Chef can get.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 500\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 1000\n0 \u2264 Wi \u2264 10^9\n\n\nExample\nInput:\n3\n5\nABCDE\nEBCDA\n0 10 20 30 40 50\n4\nCHEF\nQUIZ\n4 3 2 1 0\n8\nABBABAAB\nABABABAB\n100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100 100\n\nOutput:\n30\n4\n100\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1. If questions will be placed in order: 2^nd (Chef's answer is B, which is correct), 3^rd (Chef's answer is C, and it is correct as well), 4^th (Chef's answer is D, and he is right), 5^th (Chef's answer is A but correct answer is E and the game is over), 1^st, Chef will correctly answer 3 questions, and therefore win 30 dollars.\nExample case 2. Chef's answers for all questions are incorrect, so his winnings are W0 dollars.\nExample case 3. Since all Wi are equal to 100 dollars, Chef will win this sum in any possible case.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

So, these values are definitely should not be used for serious calculations.\nHowever, Chef doesn't know anything about 103993/33102. This fraction is quite inconvenient to calculate on paper.

Chef Ciel would like to run 2 restaurants in Wolf town, where the first restaurant will be supplied by the market S and the second one will be supplied by the market T. The markets run delivery service without charge within some distance, DS and DT respectively. Near these markets there are many rival restaurants. So Ciel decides to build one of her restaurants exactly at the distance DS from the market S, and build the other restaurant exactly at the distance DT from the market T.\nChef Ciel would like to build her restaurants as close as possible to each other for convenient communication. Your task is to calculate the minimum distance that could be achieved between her restaurants.\nNote. Wolf town can be considered as an infinite 2D Cartesian plane. The markets and Ciel's restaurants should be considered as points on a plane. The distance between the two points A and B, whose coordinates are (Ax, Ay) and (Bx, By) respectively, is defined by Dist(A, B) = ((Ax \u2212 Bx)^2 + (Ay \u2212 By)^2)^1/2.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers DS, DT and D.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the minimum possible distance between Ciel's restaurants that could be achieved. The output must have an absolute or relative error at most 0.000001 (10^\u22126). Please, note that your output should not have more than 1000 digits after the decimal point, otherwise you may (or may not) get wrong answer or runtime error (SIGXFSZ).\nNote also that the answer could be 0, which means that two Ciel's restaurants should be located at the same building.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 2013\n1 \u2264 DS, DT, D \u2264 2013\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n4\n15 15 50\n15 15 18\n43 88 200\n2013 2013 2013\n\nOutput:\n20.000\n0.0\n69.00000\n0\n\nExplanation \nExample case 1. The distance between markets S and T is 50. Assume for simplicity that S has coordinates (0, 0) and T has coordinates (50, 0). Then Ciel could build her first restaurant RS at the point (15, 0) and the second restaurant RT at the point (35, 0). This will ensure that the distance between S and RS is DS = 15 and the distance between T and RT is DT = 15. The distance between restaurants appear to be 20 in this scenario. One can prove that this is the minimum possible distance.\nExample case 2. Here Ciel can locate both her restaurants at the same place. Indeed, if S = (0, 0) and T = (18, 0) then Ciel could locate both her restaurants at the point R = (9, 12). To check this note that Dist(R, S) = ((9 \u2212 0)^2 + (12 \u2212 0)^2)^1/2 = (81 + 144)^1/2 = 225^1/2 = 15. Similarly it can be verified that Dist(R, T) = 15.\nExample case 3. It is similar to the example case 1. If S = (0, 0) and T = (200, 0) then the best way is to locate Ciel's restaurants at the points RS = (43, 0) and RT = (112, 0). You can easily check by yourself that Dist(S, RS) = 43, Dist(T, RT) = 88 and Dist(RS, RT) = 69.\nJust to reiterate, your output can have any number of digits after the decimal point unless it is too long (more than 1000 digits after decimal point). However your output must have an absolute or relative error at most 10^\u22126.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

The schedule for the trains has recently been changed and he wants to know how long it will take to travel from the station nearest to his house and the station nearest to his restaurant.\n\n\nThe Chef doesn't want to change the route he took before, so he simply has to find out how long it will take to reach his restaurant along his usual route. This route is given by a sequence of stations s0, s1, ..., sn where s0 is the station where the Chef enters the metro and sn is the station where the Chef exits the metro.\n\n\nTrains are scheduled to run between every two consecutive stations si-1 and si. Such a schedule is specified by three integers xi, li, and fi. This means that the first train on this line starts operating at time xi. The time it takes this train to travel from si-1 and si is exactly li units. Finally, a train departs from station si-1 every fi minutes following the previous train. That is, a train departs at time xi, xi+fi, xi+2fi, and so on.\n\n\n\nThe Chef is very experienced at navigating the metro so the time it takes him to transfer between trains at a given station  is essentially zero. Thus, if the Chef arrives at a station, say si, the moment that the train from si to si+1 is scheduled to depart, he skillfully hops on this next train. However, if the Chef arrives when no train to si+1 is scheduled to depart, he must wait until the scheduled departure time.\n\n\nHelp the Chef figure out how long it will take him to travel from station s0 to station sn. You may assume that the Chef is already at station s0 at time 0.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line consists of a single integer denoting the number of test cases (at most 50). Each test case begins with a line containing a single integer n between 1 and 1000 indicating the number of lines the Chef must traverse (so there are n+1 stations s0, s1, ..., sn). The next n lines describe the train schedules between stations, one per line. The i'th such line gives the values xi, li, and fi for the train that travels between stations si-1 and si.\n\n\nThe xi values will be between 0 and 1000 and the li and fi values will be between 1 and 1000.\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case you are to output a single integer denoting the minimum time t for which the Chef can reach station sn using the given route. Remember, the Chef starts at s0 at time 0.\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n3\n2\n0 4 7\n0 6 5\n2\n0 1 2\n6 2 10\n2\n1 2 3\n0 2 3\n\n\nOutput:\n11\n8\n5\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

Please help Chandan find this minimum number of operations needed to create an ideal rank list.\n\nNote that you are guaranteed that values of n, s will be given in such a way that there will exist a valid rank list.\n\nInput\nFirst line of input will give an integer T denoting number of test cases.\nThen for next T lines, each line will contain two space separated integers n, s. \n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing a single integer corresponding to the answer of the problem.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 10\n1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5\n1 \u2264 s \u2264 10^10\n\n\nExample\nInput:\n4\n1 1\n3 6\n3 5\n3 3\n\nOutput:\n0\n0\n1\n2\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1.\nOnly possible rank list in this case is {1}, As it is already an ideal rank list, hence you need zero operations.\n\nExample case 2.\nOnly possible rank list in this case is {1 2 3}, As it is already an ideal rank list, hence you need zero operations.\n\nExample case 3.\nOne of the possible rank list is {1 2 2}, You can convert it into an ideal rank list by changing any 2 to 3 i.e. {1, 2, 3}, hence you need one operations.\n\nExample case 4.\nOnly possible rank list is {1 1 1}, You can convert it into an ideal rank list by changing a 1 to 2 and another 1 to 3 i.e. {1, 2, 3}, hence you need two operations.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

        "prompt": "### Prompt\nIn the world of DragonBool there are fierce warriors called Soints. Also there are even fiercer warriors called Sofloats \u2013 the mortal enemies of Soints.\n\n\nThe power of each warrior is determined by the amount of chakra he possesses which is some positive integer. Warriors with zero level of chakra are dead warriors :) When the fight between Soint with power CI and Sofloat with power CF occurs the warrior with lower power will die and the winner will lose the amount of chakra that his enemy have possessed before the fight. So three cases are possible:\n\nCI > CF. Then Sofloat will die while the new power of Soint will be CI \u2013 CF.\nCI < CF. Then Soint will die while the new power of Sofloat will be CF \u2013 CI.\nCI = CF. In this special case both warriors die.\n\n\nEach warrior (Soint or Sofloat) has his level of skills which is denoted by some positive integer. The fight between two warriors can occur only when these warriors are Soint and Sofloat of the same level. In particual, friendly fights are not allowed, i.e., a Soint cannot fight with another Soint and the same holds for Sofloats.\n\n\nLets follow the following convention to denote the warriors. A Soint of level L and power C will be denoted as (I, C, L), while Sofloat of level L and power C will be denoted as (F, C, L). Consider some examples. If A = (I, 50, 1) fights with B = (F, 20, 1), B dies and A becomes (I, 30, 1). On the other hand, (I, 50, 1) cannot fight with (F, 20, 2) as they have different levels.\n\n\nThere is a battle between Soints and Sofloats. There are N Soints and M Sofloats in all. The battle will consist of series of fights. As was mentioned above in each fight one Soint and one Sofloat of the same level take part and after the fight the warrior with lower power will die (or both will die if they have the same power). The battle proceeds as long as there exists at least one pair of warriors who can fight. The distribution of warriors by levels satisfies the following condition: for every Soint of level L there exists at least one Sofloat of the same level L and vice-versa. So if for some level L we have at least one warrior of this level then there is at least one Soint of level L and at least one Sofloat of level L.\n\n\nThere is a powerful wizard, whose name is SoChef, on the side of Soints. He can increase the amount of chakra of each Soint by any number. SoChef wants the army of Soints to win this battle. But increasing amount of chakra of any Soint by one costs him a lot of his magic power. Hence he wants to minimize the total amount of additional chakra he should give to Soints in order for them to win. Note, however, that the win here means that all Sofloats should be dead irregardless of whether any Soint is alive. Also note that the battle can proceed by different scenarios and the SoChef need to distribute additional chakra among the Soints in such a way that they will win for any possible battle scenario. Help SoChef and find the minimal amount of additional chakra he should give to Soints in order for them to win.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers N and M. Here N is the number of Soints  participating in the battle and M is the number of Sofloats  for the same. Each of the next N lines contains two space separated integers  Ci and  Li, the amount of chakra and level of i-th Soint correspondingly. The next M lines describe power and level of Sofloats participating in the battle in the same format.\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case output a single integer on a single line, the minimum amount of chakra SoChef should give to Soints in order for them to win the battle.\n\n\nConstraints\nEach integer in the input file is positive and does not exceed 100. That is\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 100\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 100\n1 \u2264 M \u2264 100\n1 \u2264 Ci \u2264 100\n1 \u2264 Li \u2264 100\nFor every Soint of level L there exists at least one Sofloat of the same level L and vice-versa.\nIt is guaranteed that each official test file will satisfy all these constraints. You DON'T need to verify them in your program.\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n2\n2 3\n10 1\n20 2\n5 2\n5 2\n18 1\n5 5\n73 87\n69 13\n36 36\n77 46\n43 93\n49 46\n74 93\n78 87\n99 13\n59 36\n\nOutput:\n8\n89\n\n\nExplanation\n\nCase 1.\nThe warriors are I1 = (I, 10, 1), I2 = (I, 20, 2), F1 = (F, 5, 2), F2 = (F, 5, 2), F3 = (F, 18, 1). Without the SoChef help the battle can proceed as follows.\n\n\nI2 fights with F1, F1 dies, I2 becomes (I, 15, 2).\nI2 fights with F2, F2 dies, I2 becomes (I, 10, 2).\nI1 fights with F3, I1 dies, F3 becomes (F, 8, 1).\n\n\nSo if SoChef will give 8 additional units of chakra to I1 the Soints will win the battle and even one Soint (I2) will left alive. Hence the answer is 8.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

Everyday Chef Juno comes up with new problems for her to solve, otherwise she gets bored and depressed. He doesn't want her to feel so, but he has run out of all problems. He consults his Chef friends, who came up with a new problem.\nThe Chef City is an N-dimensional city of dimensions L[0]*..*L[N-1] and each of the (L[0]*..*L[N-1]) cells may have 0 to V-1 restaurants. They want to know the number of ways they can open restaurants in each cell of the city such that the sum of the number of restaurants in every sub-block(see details) in Chef City is divisible by V.\nChef Juno realizes that this number could be very huge given the size of Chef City, so to make this problem a little easier for his girlfriend (and for himself, as he should himself know the solution ;)), he wants the answer modulo 1000000007. But before asking her this problem, he wants to know the answer himself. So he turns to you for help. Please help him :)\n\nDetails\nA sub-block of an N-dimensional hyperrectangle can be defined as an N-dimensional hyperrectangle of\n1*1*..L[i]..*1*1 dimensions for i ranging from 0 to N-1, where the ith dimension is L[i].\nFor example, in a 2*3*2 cuboid, we can have sub-blocks of\n2*1*1, 1*3*1 and 1*1*2 dimensions and each of the 12 cells can have\n0 to V-1 restaurants in such a way that the sum of the number of restaurants in every sub-block is divisible by V.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers V and N.\nSince the input file size may go large, we ask you to generate the input using the following scheme.\nYou have two lines of 6 integers each.\nThe first line consists of the integers P[0], P[1], A0, B0, C0, M0.\nThe second line consists of the integers Q[0], Q[1], A1, B1, C1, M1.\nUsing the above, you can generate arrays P[] and Q[] as follows:\nP[i] = A0 * A0 * P[i-1] + B0 * P[i-2] + C0 modulo (M0)\nQ[i] = A1 * A1 * Q[i-1] + B1 * Q[i-2] + C1 modulo (M1)\nfor i \u2265 2 and i < N\nFrom this, the ith dimension can be calculated as follows: \nThe ith dimension, L[i] = P[i]*(M1)+Q[i]+1 for i \u2265 0 and i < N\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the answer. As was mentioned above, you should print this number modulo 1000000007.\n\nConstraints\n1 <= T <= 100000\n2 <= N <= 100\n1 <= V <= 2^63 - 1\n0<=A[0],A[1],B[0],B[1],C[0],C[1]<=100000\n0 <= P[0], P[1] < max(10^5+1, M0)\nand\n0 <= Q[0], Q[1] < max(10^5+1, M1)\n1<=M0 and M1<=2^31-1\nAll N dimensions after calculation will be between 1 and 2^63 \u2013 1.\n\nExample\nInput:\n\n3\n1 2\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n3 2\n1 1 1 1 1 2\n2 1 1 1 1 1\n3 3\n1 1 1 1 1 2\n1 1 0 0 0 2\nOutput:\n1\n729\n387420489\n\nExplanation\nTest case 1: Since V is equal to 1, there is only way to open restaurants in the 2 dimensional city of dimensions 3*3:\n| 0 0 0 |\n| 0 0 0 |\n| 0 0 0 |\nHere the sum of the number of restaurants opened in every sub-block of dimensions 1*3 and 3*1\n is divisible by 1.\n\n\nTest case 2: Here the dimensions of the city are 4*3 and V=3.\nSo one of the ways to open restaurants in each cell of the\ncity is:\n|1 0 2|\n|2 1 0|\n|1 2 0|\n|2 0 1|\nHere the sum of the number of restaurants opened in every sub-block of dimensions 1*3 and 4*1\nis divisible by V=3.\n\n\nTest case 3: Here we are given a 3-dimensional hyperrectangle\nof dimensions 4*4*3 and V is 3.\nSo in each of the 48 cells, we can open 0 to 2 restaurants, but we have to ensure that sum of the number of restaurants in every 4*1*1 sub-block, 1*4*1 sub-block and 1*1*3 sub-block is divisible by 3.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

        "prompt": "### Prompt\nDevu is a class teacher of a class of n students. One day, in the morning prayer of the school, all the students of his class were standing in a line. You are given information of their arrangement by a string s. The string s consists of only letters 'B' and 'G', where 'B' represents a boy and 'G' represents a girl.\nDevu wants inter-gender interaction among his class should to be maximum. So he does not like seeing two or more boys/girls standing nearby (i.e. continuous) in the line. e.g. he does not like the arrangements BBG and GBB, but he likes BG, GBG etc.\nNow by seeing the initial arrangement s of students, Devu may get furious and now he wants to change this arrangement into a likable arrangement. For achieving that, he can swap positions of any two students (not necessary continuous). Let the cost of swapping people from position i with position j (i \u2260 j) be c(i, j). You are provided an integer variable type, then the cost of the the swap will be defined by c(i, j) = |j \u2212 i|^type.\nPlease help Devu in finding minimum cost of swaps needed to convert the current arrangement into a likable one.\n\nInput\nThe first line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases are follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer type, denoting the type of the cost function. Then the next line contains string s of length n, denoting the initial arrangement s of students.\nNote that the integer n is not given explicitly in input.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the answer of the test case, that is, the minimum cost to convert the current arrangement into a likable one. If it is not possible to convert the current arrangement into a likable one, then print -1 instead of the minimum cost.\n\nConstraints and Example\nInput:\n8\n0\nBB\n0\nBG\n0\nBBGG\n1\nBGG\n1\nBGGB\n1\nBBBGG\n2\nBBGG\n2\nBGB\n\nOutput:\n-1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n3\n1\n0\n\nExplanation\nNote type of the first 3 test cases is 0. So c(i, j) = 1. Hence we just have to count minimum number of swaps needed.\nExample case 1. There is no way to make sure that both the boys does not stand nearby. So answer is -1.\nExample case 2. Arrangement is already valid. No swap is needed. So answer is 0.\nExample case 3. Swap boy at position 1 with girl at position 2. After swap the arrangement will be BGBG which is a valid arrangement. So answer is 1.\nNow type of the next 3 test cases is 1. So c(i, j) = |j \u2212 i|, that is, the absolute value of the difference between i and j.\nExample case 4. Swap boy at position 0 with girl at position 1. After swap the arrangement will be GBG which is a valid arrangement. So answer is |1 - 0| = 1.\nExample case 5. Swap boy at position 0 with girl at position 1. After swap the arrangement will be GBGB which is a valid arrangement. So answer is |1 - 0| = 1.\nExample case 6. Swap boy at position 1 with girl at position 4. After swap the arrangement will be BGBGB which is a valid arrangement. So answer is |4 - 1| = 3.\nThen type of the last 2 test cases is 2. So c(i, j) = (j \u2212 i)^2\nExample case 7. Swap boy at position 1 with girl at position 2. After swap the arrangement will be BGBG which is a valid arrangement. So answer is (2 - 1)^2 = 1.\nExample case 8. Arrangement is already valid. No swap is needed. So answer is 0.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

It takes a\ncertain amount of time before the prince can kill all the guards in\nthe room he is in.  The time taken to kill the guards varies from room\nto room.  Once he has killed all the guards in a room, he can move on\nto any one of its neighbours by going left, right, up or down,\nprovided, of course, that there is a neighbouring room in the\ncorresponding direction.\nThe wazir, knowing that the prince is on his way, has set a time\nbomb that will kill the princess after T seconds.  You will\nbe given the position of the princess, the time left for the bomb to\ngo off and the time it takes for the prince to kill the guards in each\nof the rooms in the dungeon.  Your task is to determine if it is\npossible for the prince to reach the princess and save her by defusing\nthe bomb before the T seconds expire.\n For example, suppose the dungeon is described by the following\ngrid of numbers.\n2 3 2\n2 5 1\n5 3 1\n3 1 1\n\nThe number at position (i,j) indicates the time taken for\nthe prince to overpower the guards in room (i,j).

It is quite large park that some tourists visit it more than once to fully appreciate its offerings. One day, our Chefs decided to visit the park. There are total n Chefs, i-th of them wants to visit the park ti times.\n\n\nUsually, the entry ticket for the park is very expensive. Today, being a weekend, park had an interesting offer for the visitors, \"1x Zahlen, 2x Spa\u00df\" (pay once, visit twice), i.e. you can get a second free visit after the first paid visit. The procedure for visiting the park and availing the offer is as follows.\n\nFirst time visitors should buy a ticket at the entrance of the park. Along with the ticket, you are offered an option of availing a voucher if you want a second visit.\nEnter the theme park, enjoy your visit. While returning make sure to sign your name in the voucher. Any unsigned voucher will not allowed to take out of the park.\nAfter the visit is done, the ticket counter takes back your ticket.\nIf it is your second time visit, then the counter will take back your voucher. No new voucher will be provided to you as you have already availed the offer.\nYou can avail the offer as many times as you wish in a day, i.e. offer is applicable for each visit with a paid ticket.\n\n\nObviously, this procedure has a flaw. The counter doesn't ask you to sign your name on the voucher at the time of providing it to make sure that the person buying the ticket is the one signing the voucher. So, if more than one Chefs enter the park, they can exchange their vouchers while they are inside the park.\n\n\nChefs thought of exploiting this flow. They wanted to buy minimum number of tickets. Can you help them in finding how many minimum tickets they should buy?\n\n\nLet us take an example. There are two Chef's, Alice and Bob. Alice wants to visit the park three times and Bob only once. For their first visits, each of them buys a ticket and obtains their vouchers and visits the park. After they have entered their park, Bob gives his voucher to Alice. Alice signs her name on her own voucher and on the voucher given by Bob. In this way, she has two vouchers, which she can use to visit the park two more times. So, in total by buying two tickets, Alice can visit three times and Bob once.\n\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer n denoting the number of Chefs.\nThe second line contains n space-separated integers t1, t2, ..., tn, where ti denotes the number of times i-th Chef wants to visit the park.\n\nOutput\nOutput a single integer corresponding to the minimum number of tickets Chefs needs to buy.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5\n1 \u2264 ti \u2264 10^4\n\n\nExample\nInput 1:\n2\n3 1\n\nOutput:\n2\n\nInput 2:\n4\n1 2 3 3\n\nOutput:\n5\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1.

They are shocked! Indeed, neither expect to meet a colleague in such a place with the same intentions to carry away all the money collected during Churufest 2015.\n\n\nThey have carefully counted a total of exactly 1 billion (10^9) dollars in the bank vault. Now they must decide how to divide the booty. But there is one problem: the thieves have only M minutes to leave the bank before the police arrives. Also, the more time they spend in the vault, the less amount could carry away from the bank. Formally speaking, they can get away with all of the billion dollars right now, but after t minutes they can carry away only  1\u00a0billion\u00a0*\u00a0p^t dollars, where p is some non-negative constant less than or equal to unity, and at t = M, they get arrested and lose all the money.\nThey will not leave the vault until a decision on how to divide the money has been made.\n\nThe money division process proceeds in the following way: at the beginning of each minute starting from the 1^st (that is, t = 0), one of them proposes his own way to divide the booty. If his colleague agrees, they leave the bank with pockets filled with the proposed amounts of dollars. If not, the other one proposes his way at the next minute etc. To escape arrest, they can only propose plans till the beginning of the M^th minute (i.e., till t = M-1).\nEach thief wants to maximize his earnings, but if there are two plans with the same amounts for him, he would choose the one which leads to a larger total amount of stolen dollars.\n\nChef is about to start this procedure, and he is the first to propose a plan. You are wondering what will be the final division of money, if each thief chooses the optimal way for himself and money is considering real.\n\nInput\nThe first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The only line of input for each test case contains an integer M denoting the number of minutes until arrest and a double denoting the constant p.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing two space-separated doubles denoting the amount of dollars each thief will get in the optimal division. First number: dollars amassed by Chef, and second: by his colleague. The answer will be considered correct if its absolute error doesn't exceed 10^-2.\n\nConstraints and subtasks\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 10^5\n0 \u2264 p \u2264  1  \n\nExample\nInput:\n2\n1 0.5\n2 0.5\nOutput:\n1000000000.0 0.0\n500000000.0 500000000.0\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1. In the second case, if decision isn't made at t = 0, total amount of money decreases to 5*10^8 at t = 1 which leads to a situation worse than the given solution.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

        "prompt": "### Prompt\nA daily train consists of N cars. Let's consider one particular car. It has 54 places numbered consecutively from 1 to 54, some of which are already booked and some are still free. The places are numbered in the following fashion:\n\nThe car is separated into 9 compartments of 6 places each, as shown in the picture. So, the 1st compartment consists of places 1, 2, 3, 4, 53 and 54, the 2nd compartment consists of places 5, 6, 7, 8, 51 and 52, and so on.\n\nA group of X friends wants to buy tickets for free places, all of which are in one compartment (it's much funnier to travel together). You are given the information about free and booked places in each of the N cars. Find the number of ways to sell the friends exactly X tickets in one compartment (note that the order in which the tickets are sold doesn't matter).\n\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains two integers X and N (1 \u2264 X \u2264 6, 1 \u2264 N \u2264 10) separated by a single space. Each of the following N lines contains the information about one car which is a string of length 54 consisting of '0' and '1'. The i-th character (numbered from 1) is '0' if place i in the corresponding car is free, and is '1' if place i is already booked.\n\n\nOutput\nOutput just one integer -- the requested number of ways.\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n1 3\n100101110000001011000001111110010011110010010111000101\n001010000000101111100000000000000111101010101111111010\n011110011110000001010100101110001011111010001001111010\n\nOutput:\n85\n\nInput:\n6 3\n100101110000001011000001111110010011110010010111000101\n001010000000101111100000000000000111101010101111111010\n011110011110000001010100101110001011111010001001111010\n\nOutput:\n1\n\nInput:\n3 2\n000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\n000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000\n\nOutput:\n360\n\nExplanation:\n\nIn the first test case, any of the free places can be sold. In the second test case, the only free compartment in the train is compartment 3 in the first car (places 9, 10, 11, 12, 49 and 50 are all free). In the third test case, the train is still absolutely free; as there are 20 ways to sell 3 tickets in an empty compartment, the answer is 2 * 9 * 20 = 360.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

Just mark all points (Ri,Cj) (1 <= i <= L, 1<= j <= K) on the plane and join by line segments all pairs of points that has equal abscises or ordinates and you will see that this picture is like a window.\n\nNow Chef considers some particular N x M grid and wants to calculate the total number of (L, K)-windows in this rectangular grid.

If it is impossible to calculate E1(i.e. one of the summands doesn't exist), then let's assume, that it is equal to -1.

It is impossible to calculate E1 and E2, because A3, 1 doesn't exist. So the answer is max(E1, E2) = max(-1, -1) = -1;\n\n\nIn the third test case N equals to 1, M equals to 3, L equals to 2. It is impossible to calculate E1, because A3, 1 doesn't exist. So E1 is equal to -1. E2 = 1 + 3 = 4.

Each test case begins with an integer N, the number of nodes in the tree. N lines follow with 2 integers each: the id of a node, and the sum of the ids of its children. The second number will be 0 if the node has no children.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output on a line a space separated list of all possible values for the id of the root node in increasing order. It is guaranteed that at least one such id exists for each test case.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 50\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 30\nAll node ids are between 1 and 1000, inclusive\n\n\nSample Input\n2\n1\n4 0\n6\n1 5\n2 0\n3 0\n4 0\n5 5\n6 5\n\nSample Output\n4\n6\n\nExplanation\nIn the first sample test case, there is only one node, which is clearly the root. In the second test case, there are two non-isomorphic trees that satisfy the constraints, as seen in the following picture:\n  6           6\n   \\         / \\\n    5       1   4\n   / \\       \\\n  1   4       5\n / \\         / \\\n2   3       2   3\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

There are n appetizers numbered from 0 to n-1 such that if the appetizers are arrayed in this order, they will display the message. The Chef plans to display them in this order on a table that can be viewed by all guests as they enter. The appetizers will only be served once all guests are seated.\n\n\nThe appetizers are not necessarily finished in the same order as they are numbered. So, when an appetizer is finished the Chef will write the number on a piece of paper and place it beside the appetizer on a counter between the kitchen and the restaurant. A server will retrieve this appetizer and place it in the proper location according to the number written beside it.\n\n\nThe Chef has a penchant for binary numbers. The number of appetizers created is a power of 2, say n = 2^k. Furthermore, he has written the number of the appetizer in binary with exactly k bits. That is, binary numbers with fewer than k bits are padded on the left with zeros so they are written with exactly k bits.\n\n\nUnfortunately, this has unforseen complications. A binary number still \"looks\" binary when it is written upside down. For example, the binary number \"0101\" looks like \"1010\" when read upside down and the binary number \"110\" looks like \"011\" (the Chef uses simple vertical lines to denote a 1 bit). The Chef didn't realize that the servers would read the numbers upside down so he doesn't rotate the paper when he places it on the counter. Thus, when the server picks up an appetizer they place it the location indexed by the binary number when it is read upside down.\n\n\nYou are given the message the chef intended to display and you are to display the message that will be displayed after the servers move all appetizers to their locations based on the binary numbers they read.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line consists of a single integer T \u2264 25 indicating the number of test cases to follow.

They decide to pass the time by playing a game.  \nIn this game's setup, they write N positive integers on a blackboard. Then the players take turns, starting with Henry. In a turn, a player selects one of the integers, divides it by 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6, and then takes the floor to make it an integer again. If the integer becomes 0, it is erased from the board.

Derek now has a couple of choices:\n\nDerek can divide 2 by 3, 4, 5 or 6, making it 0 and removing it. Now only one integer remains on the board, 3, and Henry can just divide it by 6 to finish, and win, the game.\nDerek can divide 3 by 4, 5 or 6, making it 0 and removing it. Now only one integer remains on the board, 2, and Henry can just divide it by 6 to finish, and win, the game.\nDerek can divide 2 by 2. Now the integers are [1,3]. Henry can respond by dividing 3 by 3. The integers are now [1,1]. Now Derek has no choice but to divide 1 by 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 and remove it (because it becomes 0). Henry can respond by dividing the remaining 1 by 2 to finish, and win, the game.\nDerek can divide 3 by 2 or 3. Now the integers are [1,2]. Henry can respond by dividing 2 by 2.

Chef has unlimited supply of cherries of K \u2264 10 different colors. Each color is denoted by the digit from the set {0, 1, ..., K \u2013 1}. Different colors are denoted by different digits. Some of the cherries are already placed and the Chef wants you to place cherries in the remaining positions. He understands that there can be many such arrangements, so in the case when the answer is not unique he asks you to find the lexicographically smallest one.\n\n\nWhat does it mean?\n\n\nLet's numerate positions for the cherries by the numbers 1, 2, ..., N starting from one of the positions in a clockwise direction. Then the current (possibly partial) arrangement of the cherries can be represented by a string of N characters. For each position i of the arrangement if the cherry of the color C is placed at this position then the i^th character of the string is equal to the digit C. Otherwise, it is equal to the question mark ?. We identify the arrangement with the string that represents it.\n\n\nOne arrangement is called lexicographically smaller than the other arrangement if at the first position where they differ the first one has smaller digit (we compare only complete arrangements so we don't care about relation between digits and the question mark). For example, the arrangement 1230123 is lexicographically smaller than 1231230 since they have first 3 equal characters but the 4^th character in the first arrangement is 0 and it is less than 1 which is the 4^th character of the second arrangement.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n The cherries at the first and the last positions are adjacent to each other (recall that we have a circular cake).\n In the case N = 1 any arrangement is valid as long as the color used for the only cherry of this arrangement is less than K.\n Initial arrangement can be already invalid (see the case 3 in the example).\n\n\n\n\nJust to make all things clear. You will be given a usual string of digits and question marks. Don't be confused by circular stuff we have in this problem. You don't have to rotate the answer once you have replaced all question marks by the digits. Think of the output like the usual string for which each two consecutive digits must be different but having additional condition that the first and the last digits must be also different (of course if N > 1).\n\n\nNext, you don't have to use all colors. The only important condition is that this string should be lexicographically smaller than all other strings that can be obtained from the input string by replacement of question marks by digits and of course it must satisfy conditions on adjacent digits.\n\n\nOne more thing, K here is not the length of the string but the number of allowed colors. Also we emphasize that the given string can have arbitrary number of question marks. So it can have zero number of question marks as well as completely consists of question marks but of course in general situation it can have both digits and question marks.\n\n\nOK. Let's try to formalize things in order to make all even more clear. You will be given an integer K and a string S=S[1]S[2]...S[N] where each S[i] is either the decimal digit less than K or the question mark. We are serious. In all tests string S can have only digits less than K. Don't ask about what to do if we have digit \u2265 K. There are no such tests at all! We guarantee this! OK, let's continue. Your task is to replace each question mark by some digit strictly less than K. If there were no question marks in the string skip this step. Now if N=1 then your string is already valid. For N > 1 it must satisfy the following N conditions S[1] \u2260 S[2], S[2] \u2260 S[3], ..., S[N-1] \u2260 S[N], S[N] \u2260 S[1]. Among all such valid strings that can be obtained by replacement of question marks you should choose lexicographically smallest one. I hope now the problem is really clear.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input file contains an integer T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. Each test case consists of exactly two lines. The first line contains an integer K, the number of available colors for cherries. The second line contains a string S that represents the current arrangement of the cherries in the cake.\n\n\nConstraints\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 1000\n1 \u2264 K \u2264 10\n1 \u2264 |S| \u2264 100, where |S| denotes the length of the string S\nEach character in S is either the digit from the set {0, 1, ..., K \u2013 1} or the question mark ?\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case output the lexicographically smallest valid arrangement of the cherries in the cake that can be obtained from the given arrangement by replacement of each question mark by some digit from 0 to K \u2013 1. If it is impossible to place the cherries output NO (output is case sensitive).\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n7\n1\n?\n2\n?0\n10\n79259?087\n2\n??\n3\n0?1\n4\n?????\n3\n012\n\nOutput:\n0\n10\nNO\n01\n021\n01012\n012\n\n\nExplanation\n\nCase 2. The only possible replacement here is 10. Note that we output 10 since we can not rotate the answer to obtain 01 which is smaller.\n\n\nCase 3. Arrangement is impossible because cherries at the first and the last positions are already of the same color. Note that K = 10 but the string has length 9. It is normal. K and |S| don't have any connection.\n\n\nCase 4. There are two possible arrangements: 01 and 10. The answer is the first one since it is lexicographically smaller.\n\n\nCase 5. There are three possible ways to replace question mark by the digit: 001, 011 and 021. But the first and the second strings are not valid arrangements as in both of them there exists an adjacent pair of cherries having the same color. Hence the answer is the third string.\n\n\nCase 6. Note that here we do not use all colors. We just find the lexicographically smallest string that satisfies condition on adjacent digit.\n\n\nCase 7. The string is already valid arrangement of digits. Hence we simply print the same string to the output.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

        "prompt": "### Prompt\nChef Po has given an online advertisement to provide Event organizing services. Chef got a huge response for his advertisement. He got various orders to conduct the events from different organizations. In turn, Chef will receive a compensation depend upon the type of event and the total numbers of persons in the event. Chef has received N orders for conducting events in this weekend in all. As weekend consists of two days all events will take place during the period of 48 hours. For the i-th order the corresponding event will start at Si hours, ends at Ei hours and Chef will receive a compensation Ci for this event. For example, if Si = 17 and Ei = 22 then duration of event is 22 \u2013 17 = 5 hours and its time period is 17:00 \u2013 22:00 of Saturday. Hours of Sunday are numbered by numbers from 24 to 48. So, for example, 10:00 of Sunday will be represented as 10 + 24 = 34. Because Chef is a newbie, the organizations had put a condition that Chef will receive a compensation for the event if and only if he is available for the entire duration of the event. It means that he can not choose overlapping events. Note, however, that if some event starts just in the moment another event has finished the Chef can safely conduct them both.\n\n\nIn general Chef will obey the orders on first come first serve basis. But on weekends Chef will select the orders in such a way that the total compensation for all the events he will conduct will be the maximal. Now your task is to help Chef and find this maximal total compensation.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains an integer N, the number of received orders for conducting events. Each of the next N lines contains three space separated integers Si, Ei, Ci, the parameters of the i-th event described in the problem statement.\n\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 10\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 2000\n0 \u2264 Si < Ei \u2264 48\n0 \u2264 Ci \u2264 10^6\n\n\nOutput\n\nOutput for each test case should contain a single integer in a separate line, the maximal compensation Chef Po can get.\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n2\n4\n1 2 100\n2 3 200\n3 4 1600\n1 3 2100\n3\n1 10 2000\n2 5 100\n6 9 400\n\nOutput:\n3700\n2000\n\n\nExplanation\n\nCase 1. The best choice here is to conduct 3rd and 4th events. The total compensation is equal to 1600 + 2100 = 3700. These events do not overlap since 3rd event starts just after the finish of the 4th one. Alternatively we can conduct first three events that also do not overlap. But in this case compensation will be only 100 + 200 + 1600 = 1900.\n\n\nCase 2. Note that first event overlaps with both second and third events, while the last two events do not overlap. Hence there are two reasonable choices available for Chef. One is to take just the first order with total compensation 2000 and the second one is to take the last two orders with total compensation 100 + 400 = 500. Clearly the first choice is better. Hence the answer is 2000.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

To be exact it differs in following points:\n\nBytelandian alphabet has the same letters as English one, but possibly different in meaning. Like 'A' in Bytelandian may be 'M' in English. However this does not mean that 'M' in Bytelandian must be 'A' in English. More formally, Bytelindian alphabet is a permutation of English alphabet. It will be given to you and could be any possible permutation. Don't assume any other condition.\nPeople of Byteland don't like to use invisible character for separating words. Hence instead of space (' ') they use underscore ('_'). Other punctuation symbols, like '?', '!' remain the same as in English.\n\nThe tourist is carrying \"The dummies guide to Bytelandian\", for translation. The book is serving his purpose nicely. But he is addicted to sharing on BaceFook, and shares his numerous conversations in Byteland on it. The conversations are rather long, and it is quite tedious to translate for his English friends, so he asks you to help him by writing a program to do the same.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T, denoting the length of the conversation, and the string M, denoting the English translation of Bytelandian string \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\". T and M are separated by exactly one space. Then T lines follow, each containing a Bytelandian sentence S which you should translate into English. See constraints for details.\n\nOutput\nFor each of the sentence in the input, output its English translation on a separate line. Replace each underscores ('_') with a space (' ') in the output. Each punctuation symbol (see below) should remain the same. Note that the uppercase letters in Bytelandian remain uppercase in English, and lowercase letters remain lowercase.

So we replace 'P' with 'H'.2) Then we see that 'h' in Bytelandian means 'i' in English. So we replace 'h' with 'i'.3) Therefore, the translation is \"Hi\".\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

So the natural way to represent a permutation is\nto list the integers in this order.

One day at a mobile recharge shop, he noticed that his service provider gives add-on plans which can lower his calling rates (Rokdas/minute). One of the plans said \"Recharge for 28 Rokdas and enjoy call rates of 0.50 Rokdas/min for one month\". Chef was very pleased. His normal calling rate is 1 Rokda/min. And he talked for 200 minutes in last month, which costed him 200 Rokdas. If he had this plan activated, it would have costed him: 28 + 0.5*200 = 128 Rokdas only! Chef could have saved 72 Rokdas. But if he pays for this add-on and talks for very little in the coming month, he may end up saving nothing or even wasting money. Now, Chef is a simple guy and he doesn't worry much about future. He decides to choose the plan based upon his last month\u2019s usage.\nThere are numerous plans. Some for 1 month, some for 15 months. Some reduce call rate to 0.75 Rokdas/min, some reduce it to 0.60 Rokdas/min. And of course each of them differ in their activation costs. Note - If a plan is valid for M months, then we must pay for (re)activation after every M months (once in M months). Naturally, Chef is confused, and you (as always) are given the task to help him choose the best plan.\n\nInput\nFirst line contains T- the number of test cases. In each test case, first line contains D- the default rate (Rokdas/minute, real number), U- the number of minutes Chef talked in last month and N- the number of add-on plans available. Then N lines follow, each containing M- the number of months the plan is valid for, R- the calling rate for the plan (Rokdas/minute, real number) and C- the cost of the plan.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output one integer- the number of the best plan (from 1 to N). Output '0' if no plan is advantageous for Chef. No two plans are equally advantageous.\n\nConstraints\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 1000.5 \u2264 D \u2264 10.0 (exactly 2 digits after the decimal point)1 \u2264 U \u2264 100001 \u2264 N \u2264 1001 \u2264 M \u2264 360.05 \u2264 R < D (exactly 2 digits after the decimal point)1 \u2264 C \u2264 1000\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n4\n1.00 200 1\n1 0.50 28\n1.00 200 2\n1 0.75 40\n3 0.60 100\n1.00 50 2\n1 0.75 40\n3 0.60 100\n1.00 100 2\n3 0.50 10\n2 0.10 20\n\nOutput:\n1\n2\n0\n2\n\nExplanation\nTest Case 1: This test case is same as the example in the problem statement.Test Case 2: This is for you to work out!Test Case 3: Chef's monthly usage is only 50 Rokdas and none of the 2 plans are advantageous, hence the answer is zero '0'.Test Case 4: Again solve it yourself, but NOTE - if Chef had chosen plan 1, he would have to pay 10 Rokdas (Activation cost), after every 3 months and NOT every month.

Now the factory is facing hard times, so currently they produce only the T-shirts of three kinds: red, green and blue T-Shirts. All the T-shirts are stored in the containers, each of the containers contain the T-Shirts of a single colour.\nNow there are N containers at the warehouse, lined up in a line. Let's enumerate the containers by the positive integers from 1 to N, starting from the leftmost and ending at the rightmost one. Their order is described with a string S. Each symbol of this string is either \"r\", \"g\" or \"b\" and denotes the colour of the respective T-shirts, stored in the container.\nOlya likes orderliness. She is not satisfied with the fact that different kinds of containers are messed up. So she wants to rearrange the containers in such a way that the number of pairs of adjacent containers that contain the T-shirts of different colors is as minimal as possible.\nFor doing that, she has a special crane. The crane is capable of doing the following things:\n\nTake a container with the number X and put it in front of all the containers. This operation takes (X-1) seconds. Note that we are considering the 1-dimensional model of the warehouse, so \"in front of all the containers\" means to the left of all the containers. The warehouse is so large, so you shouldn't worry about its' size and this operation is always performable.\nTake a container with the number X and take some container to the left of it (say, the container number Y). Remove the container number X from its' position and insert it right after the container with the number Y. This operation will take X-Y-1 seconds.\nTake a container with the number X and take some container to the right of it (say, the container number Y). Remove the container number X from its' position and insert it right after the container with the number Y. This operation will take Y-X seconds.\n\nNote that after the operation, we will re-enumerate the containers from left to right by the positive integers from 1 to N.\n \nThough Olya is keen on orderliness, she doesn't way to stay at the warehouse for long on Sunday. So she asks you to help her and to calculate the minimal possible number of seconds that is necessary to rearrange the containers in the desired way.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.

There are infinite number of unused cars, each of same model only differentiated by the their colors. The cars are of K colors.\n\n\nA zombie parent can give birth to any number of zombie-children (possibly zero), i.e. each zombie will have its parent except the head zombie which was born in the winters by combination of ice and fire.\n\n\nNow, zombies are having great difficulties to commute to their offices without cars, so they decided to use the cars available. Every zombie will need only one car. Head zombie called a meeting regarding this, in which he will allow each zombie to select a car for him.\n\n\nOut of all the cars, the head zombie chose one of cars for him. Now, he called his children to choose the cars for them. After that they called their children and so on till each of the zombie had a car. Head zombie knew that it won't be a good idea to allow children to have cars of same color as that of parent, as they might mistakenly use that. So, he enforced this rule during the selection of cars.\n\nProfessor James Moriarty is a criminal mastermind and has trapped Watson again in the zombie world. Sherlock somehow manages to go there and met the head zombie. Head zombie told Sherlock that they will let Watson free if and only if Sherlock manages to tell him the maximum number of ways in which the cars can be selected by N Zombies among all possible hierarchies. A hierarchy represents parent-child relationships among the N zombies. Since the answer may be large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7. Sherlock can not compute big numbers, so he confides you to solve this for him.\n\n\nInput\nThe first line consists of a single integer T, the number of test-cases.\nEach test case consists of two space-separated integers N and K, denoting number of zombies and the possible number of colors of the cars respectively.\n\n\nOutput\nFor each test-case, output a single line denoting the answer of the problem.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 100\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 10^9\n1 \u2264 K \u2264 10^9\n\n\nExample\nInput\n2\n2 2\n3 3\nOutput:\n2\n12\n\nExplanation\nIn the first sample test case, there are 2 zombies. Let us name them Z1 and Z2. Let one hierarchy be one in which Z1 is parent of Z2. There are 2 colors, suppose red and blue. If Z1 takes red, then Z2 should take a blue. If Z1 takes blue, then Z2 should take red. \nNote that one other possible hierarchy could be one in which Z2 is a parent of Z1. In that hierarchy also, number of possible ways of assigning cars is 2.\nSo there maximum number of possible ways is 2.\n\n\nIn the second example, we have 3 Zombies say Z1, Z2, Z3 and cars of 3 colors, suppose red, blue and green.\nA hierarchy to maximize the number of possibilities is Z1 is the parent of Z2, Z2 is the parent of Z3.\nZombie Z1 can choose one of red, blue or green cars. Z2 can choose one of the remaining two colors (as its car's color can not be same as its parent car.). Z3 can also choose his car in two colors, (one of them could be color same as Z1, and other being the color which is not same as cars of both Z1 and Z2.). This way, there can be 12 different ways of selecting the cars.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

He considered the army as \"READY FOR BATTLE\" if the count of \"lucky\" soldiers is strictly greater than the count of \"unlucky\" soldiers, and \"NOT READY\" otherwise.\nGiven the number of weapons each soldier is holding, your task is to determine whether the army formed by all these soldiers is \"READY FOR BATTLE\" or \"NOT READY\".\nNote: You can find the definition of an even number here.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of input consists of a single integer N denoting the number of soldiers. The second line of input consists of N space separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN, where Ai denotes the number of weapons that the i^th soldier is holding.\n\nOutput\nGenerate one line output saying \"READY FOR BATTLE\", if the army satisfies the conditions that Kattapa requires or \"NOT READY\" otherwise (quotes for clarity).\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 100\n1 \u2264 Ai \u2264 100\n\n\nExample 1\nInput:\n1\n1\n\nOutput:\nNOT READY\n\nExample 2\nInput:\n1\n2\n\nOutput:\nREADY FOR BATTLE\n\nExample 3\nInput:\n4\n11 12 13 14\n\nOutput:\nNOT READY\n\nExample 4\nInput:\n3\n2 3 4\n\nOutput:\nREADY FOR BATTLE\n\nExample 5\nInput:\n5\n1 2 3 4 5\n\nOutput:\nNOT READY\n\nExplanation\n\n\nExample 1: For the first example, N = 1 and the array A = [1]. There is only 1 soldier and he is holding 1 weapon, which is odd. The number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons = 0, and number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons = 1. Hence, the answer is \"NOT READY\" since the number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons is not greater than the number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons.\nExample 2: For the second example, N = 1 and the array A = [2]. There is only 1 soldier and he is holding 2 weapons, which is even. The number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons = 1, and number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons = 0. Hence, the answer is \"READY FOR BATTLE\" since the number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons is greater than the number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons.\nExample 3: For the third example, N = 4 and the array A = [11, 12, 13, 14]. The 1^st soldier is holding 11 weapons (which is odd), the 2^nd soldier is holding 12 weapons (which is even), the 3^rd soldier is holding 13 weapons (which is odd), and the 4^th soldier is holding 14 weapons (which is even). The number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons = 2, and number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons = 2. Notice that we have an equal number of people holding even number of weapons and odd number of weapons. The answer here is \"NOT READY\" since the number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons is not strictly greater than the number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons.\nExample 4: For the fourth example, N = 3 and the array A = [2, 3, 4]. The 1^st soldier is holding 2 weapons (which is even), the 2^nd soldier is holding 3 weapons (which is odd), and the 3^rd soldier is holding 4 weapons (which is even). The number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons = 2, and number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons = 1. Hence, the answer is \"READY FOR BATTLE\" since the number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons is greater than the number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons.\nExample 5: For the fifth example, N = 5 and the array A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The 1^st soldier is holding 1 weapon (which is odd), the 2^nd soldier is holding 2 weapons (which is even), the 3^rd soldier is holding 3 weapons (which is odd), the 4^th soldier is holding 4 weapons (which is even), and the 5^th soldier is holding 5 weapons (which is odd). The number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons = 2, and number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons = 3. Hence, the answer is \"NOT READY\" since the number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons is not greater than the number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

I guess its hard to code while thinking of Samosa, especially if you are very hungry now ; so lets not get in to any recipe or eating game. \n\nYou have N  boxes of Samosas, where each box is a cube. To pack a box, you need to use a rubber band ( pseudo-circular, elastic band ) by placing it around the box ( along 4 faces of the cube ).  A (R1,R2)-rubber band has initial radius R1 and it can stretch at max to radius R2 without breaking. You can pack a cubical box of side length L using a rubber band of circumference 4 * L ( see Notes for clarity). Given M rubber bands along with their initial radius and max radius, we need to match ( assign ) some rubber bands to boxes. A box needs at least one rubber band to pack it and of course, each rubber band can be used to pack at most one box. Find the maximum number of boxes we can pack.\n\n\nNotesA pseudo-circular rubber band having a radius R has circumference of 2 * K * R , where K is a constant = 22 / 7. So, a (R1,R2) rubber band can be used to pack a cubical box of side length L, only if 2 * K * R1 <= 4 * L <= 2 * K * R2\n\nInput\nFirst line contains an integer T ( number of test cases, around 20 ). T cases follow. Each test case starts with an integer N ( number of boxes, 1 <= N <= 1000 ). Next line contains N integers, the side lengths L of the N boxes ( 1 <= L <= 100,000,000 ). Next line contains an integer M ( number of rubber bands, 1 <= M <= 1000 ). Each of the next M lines contains two integers R1 R2 ( 1 <= R1 <= R2 <= 100,000,000 ), separated by a space.\n\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output the maximum number of boxes you can pack, in a new line.\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n1\n4\n10 20 34 55\n4\n7 14\n7 21\n14 21\n7 35\n\nOutput:\n2\n\n\nExplanation:\nOnly 1 test case here, and a possible answer can be, using (7,14) rubber band to pack box L = 10, and using (7,35) rubber band to pack box L = 55. We cannot pack more than 2 boxes.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

That is, in the i^th column, there is no soil from the li^th cell to the hi^th cell (both inclusive). Chef can build additional gaps by clearing some cells of soil. His tractor has height H, and therefore, he needs to build a horizontal corridor of height H passing through all the columns. That is, some consecutive H rows must have no soil.

So Messi decided to settle things down for good and now he is conducting the ball on his teams' midfield and he will start a lethal counter-attack :D\nAfter dribbling the 2 strikers from Chelsea, he now finds himself near the center of the field and he won't be able to dribble the entire team on his own, so he will need to pass the ball to one of his teammates, run forward and receive the ball once again to score the final goal.\nExactly K players are with him on his counter-attack and the coach, Tito Villanova knows that this counter-attack will end in a goal only if after exactly N passes are performed between the players, Messi ends up with the ball.\n (Note that the ball only needs to end with Messi after exactly N passes are performed between all the K+1 players, i.e. Messi can receive the ball several times during the N passes.

So help him!!\n\nInput\nInput will contain a number T denoting the number of test cases.\nThen T test cases follow, each one consisting of two space-sparated integers N and K.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single integer, the number of ways the winning play might happen modulo 1000000007 (10^9+7).\n\nConstraints\n\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 100\n2 \u2264 N \u2264 1000\n1 \u2264 K \u2264 10\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n2\n2 4\n4 2\n\nOutput:\n4\n6\n\nExplanation\nIn the first test case, say four players with Messi are Xavi, Busquets, Iniesta and Jordi Alba. Then the ways of the winning play to happen when exactly  2 passes are to be performed are:1) Messi - Xavi - Messi2) Messi - Busquets - Messi3) Messi - Iniesta - Messi4) Messi - Alba - Messi \nIn the second test case, also say that two players with Messi are Xavi and Iniesta.

But suddenly they were stopped by the policeman Big Hippo, who wanted to make an alcohol test for elephants.\nThere were N elephants ordered from the left to the right in a row and numbered from 0 to N-1. Let R[i] to be the result of breathalyzer test of i-th elephant.\nConsidering current laws in the Zoo, elephants would be arrested if there exists K consecutive elephants among them for which at least M of these K elephants have the maximal test result among these K elephants.\nUsing poor math notations we can alternatively define this as follows. The elephants would be arrested if there exists i from 0 to N-K, inclusive, such that for at least M different values of j from i to i+K-1, inclusive, we have R[j] = max{R[i], R[i+1], ..., R[i+K-1]}.\n\nThe Big Hippo is very old and the Little Elephant can change some of the results. In a single operation he can add 1 to the result of any elephant. But for each of the elephants he can apply this operation at most once.\nWhat is the minimum number of operations that the Little Elephant needs to apply, such that the sequence of results, after all operations will be applied, let elephants to avoid the arrest? If it is impossible to avoid the arrest applying any number of operations, output -1.\n\nInput\n The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains three space-separated integers N, K, M. The second line contains N space-separated integers  R[0], R[1], ..., R[N-1] denoting the test results of the elephants.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the minimum number of operations needed to avoid the arrest.\n\nConstraints\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 10\n1 \u2264 M \u2264 K \u2264 N \u2264 17\n1 \u2264 R[i] \u2264 17\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n4\n5 3 2\n1 3 1 2 1\n5 3 3\n7 7 7 7 7\n5 3 3\n7 7 7 8 8\n4 3 1\n1 3 1 2\n\nOutput:\n0\n1\n1\n-1\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1. Let's follow the poor math definition of arrest. We will consider all values of i from 0 to N-K = 2, inclusive, and should count the number of values of j described in the definition. If it less than M = 2 then this value of i does not cause the arrest, otherwise causes.\n\n\ni\n{R[i],...,R[i+K-1]}\nmax{R[i],...,R[i+K-1]}\nFor which j = i, ..., i+K-1 we have R[j] = max\nConclusion\n\n\ni=0\n{1, 3, 1}\nmax = 3\nR[j] = 3 for j = 1\ndoes not cause the arrest\n\n\ni=1\n{3, 1, 2}\nmax = 3\nR[j] = 3 for j = 1\ndoes not cause the arrest\n\n\ni=2\n{1, 2, 1}\nmax = 2\nR[j] = 2 for j = 3\ndoes not cause the arrest\n\n\nSo we see that initial test results of the elephants do not cause their arrest. Hence the Little Elephant does not need to apply any operations. Therefore, the answer is 0.\nExample case 2.We have N = 5, K = 3, M = 3. Let's construct similar table as in example case 1. Here the value of i will cause the arrest if we have at least 3 values of j described in the definition.\n\n\ni\n{R[i],...,R[i+K-1]}\nmax{R[i],...,R[i+K-1]}\nFor which j = i, ..., i+K-1 we have R[j] = max\nConclusion\n\n\ni=0\n{7, 7, 7}\nmax = 7\nR[j] = 7 for j = 0, 1, 2\ncauses the arrest\n\n\ni=1\n{7, 7, 7}\nmax = 7\nR[j] = 7 for j = 1, 2, 3\ncauses the arrest\n\n\ni=2\n{7, 7, 7}\nmax = 7\nR[j] = 7 for j = 2, 3, 4\ncauses the arrest\n\n\nSo we see that for initial test results of the elephants each value of i causes their arrest. Hence the Little Elephant needs to apply some operations in order to avoid the arrest. He could achieve his goal by adding 1 to the result R[2]. Then results will be {R[0], R[1], R[2], R[3], R[4]} = {7, 7, 8, 7, 7}. Let's check that now elephants will be not arrested.\n\n\ni\n{R[i],...,R[i+K-1]}\nmax{R[i],...,R[i+K-1]}\nFor which j = i, ..., i+K-1 we have R[j] = max\nConclusion\n\n\ni=0\n{7, 7, 8}\nmax = 8\nR[j] = 8 for j = 2\ndoes not cause the arrest\n\n\ni=1\n{7, 8, 7}\nmax = 8\nR[j] = 8 for j = 2\ndoes not cause the arrest\n\n\ni=2\n{8, 7, 7}\nmax = 8\nR[j] = 8 for j = 2\ndoes not cause the arrest\n\n\nSo we see that now test results of the elephants do not cause their arrest. Thus we see that using 0 operations we can't avoid the arrest but using 1 operation can. Hence the answer is 1.\nExample case 3.We have N = 5, K = 3, M = 3. Let's construct similar table as in example case 1. Here the value of i will cause the arrest if we have at least 3 values of j described in the definition.\n\n\ni\n{R[i],...,R[i+K-1]}\nmax{R[i],...,R[i+K-1]}\nFor which j = i, ..., i+K-1 we have R[j] = max\nConclusion\n\n\ni=0\n{7, 7, 7}\nmax = 7\nR[j] = 7 for j = 0, 1, 2\ncauses the arrest\n\n\ni=1\n{7, 7, 8}\nmax = 8\nR[j] = 8 for j = 3\ndoes not cause the arrest\n\n\ni=2\n{7, 8, 8}\nmax = 8\nR[j] = 8 for j = 3, 4\ndoes not cause the arrest\n\n\nSo we see that for initial test results of the elephants the value of i = 0 causes their arrest. Hence the Little Elephant needs to apply some operations in order to avoid the arrest. He could achieve his goal by adding 1 to the result R[1]. Then results will be {R[0], R[1], R[2], R[3], R[4]} = {7, 8, 7, 8, 8}. Let's check that now elephants will be not arrested.\n\n\ni\n{R[i],...,R[i+K-1]}\nmax{R[i],...,R[i+K-1]}\nFor which j = i, ..., i+K-1 we have R[j] = max\nConclusion\n\n\ni=0\n{7, 8, 7}\nmax = 8\nR[j] = 8 for j = 1\ndoes not cause the arrest\n\n\ni=1\n{8, 7, 8}\nmax = 8\nR[j] = 8 for j = 1, 3\ndoes not cause the arrest\n\n\ni=2\n{7, 8, 8}\nmax = 8\nR[j] = 8 for j = 3, 4\ndoes not cause the arrest\n\n\nSo we see that now test results of the elephants do not cause their arrest. Thus we see that using 0 operations we can't avoid the arrest but using 1 operation can. Hence the answer is 1. Note that if we increase by 1 the result R[2] instead of R[1] then the value i = 2 will cause the arrest since {R[2], R[3], R[4]} will be {8, 8, 8} after this operation and we will have 3 values of j from 2 to 4, inclusive, for which R[j] = max{R[2], R[3], R[4]}, namely, j = 2, 3, 4.\nExample case 4. When M = 1 the Little Elephant can't reach the goal since for each value of i from 0 to N-K we have at least one value of j for which R[j] = max{R[i], R[i+1], ..., R[i+K-1]}.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

The rules of this competition are quite simple.\n\n Each participant needs to bring his or her best dish. The judges will initially assign a score to each of the dishes. Now, several rounds will follow. In each round, any two chefs will be called up on the stage. Each of the chefs can then choose any one dish to battle against the other chef and the one having the dish with the higher score will win this round. The winner of the round will also obtain all the dishes of the loser who will then be eliminated. In case both the dishes have equal scores, this round will be considered as a tie and nothing else will happen. Note that initially each chef will have only one dish and all the chefs play the rounds optimally.\n\n Your task is to simulate and answer some queries related to this. You will be given N dishes numbered from 1 to N with the i^th dish belonging to the i^th chef initially. You will also be given an array S where S[i] denotes the score given by the judges to the i^th dish before starting the rounds. You will have to answer Q queries, each of which can be of the following types :  \n1.  0 x y : This denotes that the chef containing dish number x  competes with the chef containing dish number  y  currently in this round. If a single chef is the owner of both the dishes, print \"Invalid query!\" (without quotes), otherwise execute and store the result of this round as described by the rules above.  \n2.  1 x  : You need to output the index of the chef containing dish x  at this point.\n\nInput\nFirst line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer N denoting the number of chefs in the contest. The next line contains N space separated integers where the i^th integer represents S[i]. The next line contains an integer Q denoting the number of queries.  Q  lines follow where each line can be of the format  0 x y  or  1 x  as described in the problem statement. \n\nOutput\n For each test, print in each line the answer for the queries as described in the problem statement .\n\nConstraints\n\n 1 \u2264 T \u2264 25 \n 1 \u2264 N \u2264 10000(10^4) \n 0 \u2264 S[i] \u2264 1000000(10^6)\n 1 \u2264 Q \u2264 10000(10^4)\n 1 \u2264 x, y \u2264  N\n\n\n\nExample\nInput:\n1\n2\n1 2\n2\n0 1 2\n1 1\nOutput:\n2\n\nExplanation\n\nThere are two chefs with scores of dishes  1  and  2  respectively. After the first query, chef  2  acquires dish  1  since  S[2] > S[1] . Hence, the answer for the second query, i.e owner of the first dish is chef 2.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

        "prompt": "### Prompt\nThe Kalakeyas were a powerful, ferocious and cruel clan of Danavas. They were known to be really strong and they did not have any war strategy. They would just attack the enemy randomly and overpower them with sheer number of soldiers. However, we all know that Baahubali and Bhallaladeva defeated the Kalakeyas by following the Thrishul strategy, and successfully defended their kingdom Maahishmati. We also know that Baahubali was very smart, and the truth is that he predicted how the Kalakeyas would attack and  devised a counter strategy for the same, the night before the war. This is what he found:\nThe Kalakeyas had N forts, numbered 1 to N and Baahubali had N soldiers, numbered 1 to N. Baahubali discovered that he can permute his soldiers in any way to get a permutation of 1 to N => P1, P2, ..., PN. He would then send his soldiers to attack the forts in the following way: soldier P1 attacks fort 1, soldier P2 attacks fort 2, ..., soldier PN attacks fort N. It is easy to note that each soldier attacks exactly one fort and no two soldiers attack the same fort. Baahubali also got to know about a secret key of the Kalakeyas, which is an integer K. A soldier X can destroy a fort Y, iff abs(X - Y) \u2265 K. For more details on the abs() function, check here.\n\nYour task is to determine whether Baahubali's soldiers can be permuted in some way, such that all forts can be destroyed. In other words, for a permutation P1, P2, ..., PN, Baahubali's soldiers can destroy all the forts iff abs(Pi - i) \u2265 K, for all 1 <= i <= N. If this is possible, you are also required to output the lexicographically smallest such permutation. If it is not possible, output -1.\n\nNote: A permutation A1, A2, ..., AN is said to be lexicographically smaller than a permutation B1, B2, ..., BN, if and only if at the first i where Ai and Bi differ, Ai comes before Bi. You can refer here for a more detailed definition of lexicographic ordering.\n\n\nInput\nThe first line of input consists of a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each of the following T lines contain two space separated integers N and K denoting the values mentioned in the statement above.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing N space separated integers (which should be a permutation of [1..N], if Baahubali's soldiers can break all the forts. If it is not possible to break all the forts, output \"-1\" (quotes for clarity).\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 1000\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 10^5\n0 \u2264 K \u2264 N\nThe sum of N over all test cases in a single test file will not exceed 10^5\n\n\nExample\nInput:\n3\n2 2\n3 0\n3 1\n\nOutput:\n-1\n1 2 3\n2 3 1\n\nExplanation\nFor the first test case, N = 2 and K = 2. It is impossible to permute [1, 2] in any way such that abs(P[1]-1) \u2265 2 and abs(P[2]-2) \u2265 2. Hence, output is -1.\nFor the second test case, N = 3 and K = 0. We can just set P[i] = i, and hence the answer is 1 2 3\nFor the third case, the valid permutations are [2, 3, 1] and [3, 1, 2]. The answer is [2, 3, 1] since it is lexicographically smaller than [3, 1, 2].\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

How it will happen?\nChef arranges the N robots in a row, in the (increasing) order of their indices. Then, he chooses the first M robots and moves them to the end of the queue. Now, Chef goes to the robot at the first position in the row and hands it one cake. He then notes this robot's index (say k) in his notebook, and goes to the k^th position in the row. If the robot at this position does not have a cake, he give him one cake, notes his index in his notebook, and continues the same process. If a robot visited by Chef already has a cake with it, then he stops moving and the cake assignment process is stopped.\nChef will be satisfied if all robots have a cake in the end. In order to prepare the kitchen staff for Chef's wrath (or happiness :) ), you must find out if he will be satisfied or not? If not, you have to find out how much robots have a cake, so that the kitchen staff can prepare themselves accordingly.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.\nThe single line of each test cases contains two space separated integers N and M.\n\n\nOutput\nFor each of the T test cases, output a single line:\n\nIf all N robots have a cake, output \"Yes\" (without quotes).\nOtherwise, output \"No\" (without quotes) followed by a space and the number of robots which have a cake.\n\n\nConstraints and Example\nInput:\n3\n2 0\n2 1\n4 2\n\nOutput:\nNo 1\nYes\nNo 2\n\n\nExplanation\nIn test case 1, we have two robots indexed 1 and 2. They are arranged as (1 2). Chef goes to the first robot, gives him a cake, and moves to position 1. In the next step, he sees that robot at this position already has a has cake. So Chef stops moving, and our answer is \"No 1\".\nIn test case 2, we again have two robots indexed 1 and 2. Initially, they are arranged as (1 2). Then, Chef moves robot#1 to the end of the row, and thus the arrangement becomes (2 1). Chef goes to the robot at the first position, which is robot#2. Chef hands him a cake, and moves to position 2. Then, he hands a cake to robot#1 at position 2, and moves back to the first position. Since, robot#2 at the first position already ahs a cake, Chef stops moving. All N robots have cakes, so Chef is satisfied, and our answer is \"Yes\".\nIn the 3^rd test case, we have the following arrangement of robots: (3 4 1 2). Only robots with indices 3 and 1 will get cakes. So our answer is \"No 2\".\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

The time shown above (3:33) is an example of such a situation. Other examples are 2:2 and 1:11. Note that the digits of 33:33 are identical, but it is not a valid time on a usual digital clock.\nThe above example was for a usual 24-hour format digital clock. Let's consider a more general clock, where an hour lasts M minutes and a day lasts H hours (therefore, the clock can show any number of hours between 0 and H-1, inclusive, and any number of minutes between 0 and M-1, inclusive).

Originated in ancient China, they can also be found in some areas of Tibet and Nepal that are close to Han Chinese populations, as well as areas of Thailand, Laos and Burma which have significant Chinese populations. Chopsticks are most commonly made of wood, bamboo or plastic, but in China, most are made out of bamboo. Chopsticks are held in the dominant hand, between the thumb and fingers, and used to pick up pieces of food.]\n\n Retrieved from wikipedia\nActually, the two sticks in a pair of chopsticks need not be of the same length. A pair of sticks can be used to eat as long as the difference in their length is at most D. The Chef has N sticks in which the i^th stick is L[i] units long. A stick can't be part of more than one pair of chopsticks. Help the Chef in pairing up the sticks to form the maximum number of usable pairs of chopsticks.\n\nInput\nThe first line contains two space-separated integers N and D.

The maximum value on any cell would be 1.\nTest Case 2: If Chef selects two paths that have a common cell, such as\n\n\n(1,1)->(1,2)->(2,2)->(3,2)->(3,3)\n(1,1)->(2,1)->(2,2)->(3,2)->(3,3)\n\nThen the value of S will be equal to 2, since the number of stones in (2,2) and (3,2) is equal to 2. But, if Chef selects two paths which do not have any common cells, such as\n\n\n(1,1)->(1,2)->(1,3)->(2,3)->(3,3)\n(1,1)->(2,1)->(3,1)->(3,2)->(3,3)\n\nThen the value of S will be equal to 1.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

He discovered that the best way to train finger speed is to play scales.\nThere are different kinds of scales which are divided on the basis of their interval patterns. For instance, major scale is defined by pattern T-T-S-T-T-T-S, where \u2018T\u2019 stands for a whole tone whereas \u2018S\u2019 stands for a semitone. Two semitones make one tone. To understand how they are being played, please refer to the below image of piano\u2019s octave \u2013 two consecutive keys differ by one semitone.\nIf we start playing from first key (note C), then we\u2019ll play all white keys in a row (notes C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C \u2013 as you can see C and D differ for a tone as in pattern, and E and F differ for a semitone).\nThis pattern could be played some number of times (in cycle).\n\nEach time Chef takes some type of a scale and plays using some number of octaves. Sometimes Chef can make up some scales, so please don\u2019t blame him if you find some scale that does not exist in real world.\nFormally, you have a set of 12 keys (i.e. one octave) and you have N such sets in a row. So in total, you have 12*N keys. You also have a pattern that consists of letters 'T' and 'S', where 'T' means move forward for two keys (from key x to key x + 2, and 'S' means move forward for one key (from key x to key x + 1).\nNow, you can start playing from any of the 12*N keys. In one play, you can repeat the pattern as many times as you want, but you cannot go outside the keyboard.\nRepeating pattern means that if, for example, you have pattern STTST, you can play STTST as well as STTSTSTTST, as well as STTSTSTTSTSTTST, as well as any number of repeating. For this pattern, if you choose to repeat it once, if you start at some key x, you'll press keys: x (letter 'S')-> x + 1 (letter 'T')-> x + 3 (letter 'T')-> x + 5 (letter 'S') -> x + 6 (letter 'T')-> x + 8. Also 1 \u2264 x, x + 8 \u2264 12*N so as to avoid going off the keyboard.\nYou are asked to calculate number of different plays that can be performed. Two plays differ if and only if they start at different keys or patterns are repeated different number of times.\n\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nFirst line of each test case contains scale\u2019s pattern \u2013 string s consisting of letters \u2018T\u2019 and \u2018S\u2019 only.\nSecond line contains one integer N \u2013 number of octaves he\u2019ll be using.\n\n\nOutput\nFor each test case output a single number in a line corresponding to number of different scales he\u2019ll play.\u00a0\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 10^5\n1 \u2264 |S| \u2264 100\n1 \u2264 n \u2264 7\n\n\nExample\nInput:\n2 \nTTTT\n1\nTTSTTTS\n3\n\nOutput:\n4\n36\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1.

Then he intended to divide the fruit into several parts. In order to do it he planned to separate the neighbouring segments in k places, so that he could get k parts: the 1^st - from segment l1 to segment r1 (inclusive), the 2^nd - from l2 to r2, ..., the k^th - from lk to rk (in all cases in the clockwise order). Suddenly, when Chef was absent, one naughty boy came and divided the tangerine into p parts (also by separating the neighbouring segments one from another): the 1^st - from segment a1 to segment b1, the 2^nd - from a2 to b2, ..., the p^th - from ap to bp (in all cases in the clockwise order). Chef became very angry about it! But maybe little boy haven't done anything wrong, maybe everything is OK? Please, help Chef to determine whether he is able to obtain the parts he wanted to have (in order to do it he can divide p current parts, but, of course, he can't join several parts into one).\n Please, note that parts are not cyclic. That means that even if the tangerine division consists of only one part, but that part include more than one segment, there are two segments which were neighbouring in the initial tangerine but are not neighbouring in the division. See the explanation of example case 2 to ensure you understood that clarification.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains three space separated integers n, k, p, denoting the number of tangerine's segments and number of parts in each of the two divisions.

        "prompt": "### Prompt\nChef Ciel wants to put a fancy neon signboard over the entrance of her restaurant. She has not enough money to buy the new one so she bought some old neon signboard through the internet. Ciel was quite disappointed when she received her order - some of its letters were broken. But she realized that this is even better - she could replace each broken letter by any letter she wants. So she decided to do such a replacement that the resulting signboard will contain the word \"CHEF\" as many times as possible.\nWe can model the signboard as a string S having capital letters from 'A' to 'Z', inclusive, and question marks '?'. Letters in the string indicate the intact letters at the signboard, while question marks indicate broken letters. So Ciel will replace each question mark with some capital letter and her goal is to get the string that contains as many substrings equal to \"CHEF\" as possible. If there exist several such strings, she will choose the lexicographically smallest one.\nNote 1. The string S = S1...SN has the substring \"CHEF\" if for some i we have SiSi+1Si+2Si+3 = \"CHEF\". The number of times \"CHEF\" is the substring of S is the number of those i for which SiSi+1Si+2Si+3 = \"CHEF\".\nNote 2. The string A = A1...AN is called lexicographically smaller than the string B = B1...BN if there exists K from 1 to N, inclusive, such that Ai = Bi for i = 1, ..., K-1, and AK < BK. In particular, A is lexicographically smaller than B if A1 < B1. We compare capital letters by their positions in the English alphabet. So 'A' is the smallest letter, 'B' is the second smallest letter, ..., 'Z' is the largest letter.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains a string S.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the content of the signboard Chef Ciel will come up with. That is you should output the lexicographically smallest string that could be obtained from the input string by replacing all its question marks by some capital letters and having as many substrings equal to \"CHEF\" as possible.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 2013\n1 \u2264 length of S \u2264 2013\nEach character in S is either a capital letter from 'A' to 'Z', inclusive, or the question mark '?'.\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n5\n????CIELIS???E?\n????CIELISOUR???F\nT?KEITE?SY\n????????\n???C???\n\nOutput:\nCHEFCIELISACHEF\nCHEFCIELISOURCHEF\nTAKEITEASY\nCHEFCHEF\nAAACHEF\n\nExplanation \nExample Case 1. Here the resulting string can have at most 2 substrings equal to \"CHEF\". For example, some possible such strings are:\n\nCHEFCIELISACHEF\nCHEFCIELISQCHEF\nCHEFCIELISZCHEF\n\nHowever, lexicographically smallest one is the first one.\nExample Case 3. Here the resulting string cannot have \"CHEF\" as its substring. Therefore, you must simply output the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained from the given one by replacing question marks with capital letters.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

        "prompt": "### Prompt\nYou are in charge of painting the lanes on a 500 meter race track for a forthcoming amateur track event. There are 9 lanes in total which means you must paint 10 lines around the track to delimit these lanes. Fortunately, you have special equipment that will help you paint these lanes very quickly.\n\n\nThis equipment has 10 paint nozzles arranged in a line and the spacing between consecutive nozzles is exactly equal to the width of a lane. So, all you have to do is drag this equipment around the track once while all 10 nozzles are spraying to paint all of the lines that delimit the lanes.\n\n\nUnfortunately, the equipment is a old and the paint doesn't apply evenly. Specifically, an air bubble can appear in a nozzle's paint supply line causing the nozzle to spray air instead of paint for a while. Since this event is not professional, it is ok to have some parts of the lines missing as long as each racer always has one of its two sides painted at any point on the track.\n\n\nYou only realized this after you finished dragging the equipment around the track. The equipment has some basic computing power and sensors and it was able to record when a nozzle was not working properly due to a paint bubble. So, instead of walking over the entire track, you can analyze the data. Your boss wants to know precisely how many meters out of the 500 meters of the race track are such that every lane has at least one of its sides painted along that meter.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer T \u2264 30 indicating the number of test cases. Each test case begins with a single integer B indicating the number of bubbles that were recorded by the equipment's computer.\n\n\nThen B lines follow with 0 \u2264 B \u2264 300, each describing a single bubble. A bubble is described by three integers S, E, L where S is the meter of the track where the bubble first appeared and E is the meter of the track when the bubble disappeared. This means that paint is not applied from meter S through to, and including, meter E. This bubble appears on paint line L. Here, 1 \u2264 S \u2264 E \u2264 500 and 0 \u2264 L \u2264 9.\n\n\nFor example, if a bubble starts at meter 12 and ends at meter 15 on paint line 3, then there is no paint appearing on line number 3 over meters 12, 13, 14, and 15. In total, 4 meters of the line are not painted due to this particular bubble.\n\n\nSay the lanes are numbered from 1 to 9. Then lane 1 is delimited by lines 0 and 1, lane 2 by lines 1 and 2, lane 3 by lines 2 and 3, and so on. Also, the input will be such that no two bubbles in the same paint line share a common meter of the track. That is, if S,E and S',E' are the start and endpoints of two different bubbles on a common line L, then either E < S' or E' < S.\n\n\nOutput\n\nThe output for each test case consists of a single integer on a single line. This integer is the number of meters (out of 500) are such that every one of the 9 lanes on the track has at least one of the lines delimiting that lane fully painted throughout that meter.\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n3\n2\n1 3 1\n2 5 2\n2\n1 3 1\n2 5 3\n5\n60 60 4\n60 61 5\n61 61 6\n100 100 8\n100 100 9\n\nOutput:\n498\n500\n497\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

You are given initial height of the i-th tree by Hi and the rate of growth of height as Ri meters per month. For simplicity, you can assume that all the trees are perfect cylinders of equal radius. This allows us to consider only the height of trees when we talk about the amount of wood.\n\n\nIn Chef's country, laws don't allow one to cut a tree partially, so one has to cut the tree completely for gathering wood. Also, laws prohibit cutting trees of heights (strictly) lower than L meters.\n\n\nToday Chef received an order of W meters (of height) of wood. Chef wants to deliver this order as soon as possible. Find out how minimum number of months he should wait after which he will able to fulfill the order. You can assume that Chef's company's sawing machines are very efficient and take negligible amount of time to cut the trees.\n\n\nInput\nThere is a single test case per test file.\nThe first line of the input contains three space separated integers N, W and L denoting the number of trees in the farm, the amount of wood (in meters) that have to be gathered and the minimum allowed height of the tree to cut.\nEach of next N lines contain two space separated integers denoting Hi and Ri respectively.\n\nOutput\nOutput a single integer denoting the number of months that have to pass before Chef will be able to fulfill the order.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 10^5\n1 \u2264 W, L \u2264 10^18\n1 \u2264 Hi, Ri \u2264 10^9\n\n\nExample\nInput:\n3 74 51\n2 2\n5 7\n2 9\n\nOutput:\n7\n\nExplanation\nAfter 6 months, heights of each tree will be 14, 47 and 56 respectively. Chef is allowed to cut only the third tree, sadly it is not enough to fulfill an order of 74 meters of wood.\nAfter 7 months, heights of each tree will be 16, 54 and 65 respectively. Now Chef is allowed to cut second and third trees. Cutting both of them would provide him 119 meters of wood, which is enough to fulfill the order.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

A discussion of possible approaches to solving this problem can be found in our blog.\nOne evening Johnny found some funny looking beens in his grandfather's garden shed, and decided to plant one of them. Next morning, to his surprise he found an enormous beanstalk growing in his back yard. Undaunted by its size, he decided to count its leaves.\n\nYou must know that beanstalks in Byteland grow in a very special way. At the lowest (1st) level, there is exactly one stem. At any level(including the 1st), a stem can end (forming exactly one leaf), or branch into exactly two stems which grow into the next level, following the same rules.\n\nJohnny believes he has managed to count the number of leaves at each of the levels of the beanstalk. However, you must know that before he began to count, Johnny ate one or two of the other beans he found in his grandfather's shed, and that's why he is not quite sure of his results. Please verify whether Johnny's results may possibly be correct, at least in theory.\n\n\n\nInput\nThe input starts with a line containing integer t, the number of test cases (1 \u2264 t \u2264 20). The descriptions of exactly t test cases follow.\nEach test case starts with an integer k, representing the number of levels of the beanstalk (1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^6). The next k non-negative space-separated integers (not greater than 10^6) represent the number of leaves of the beanstalk at successive levels, starting from level 1.\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a line containing exactly one of the words 'Yes' or 'No', depending on whether a beanstalk having the stated leaf counts can grow in accordance with the Bytelandian rules.\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n2\n3\n0 1 2\n3\n0 0 3\n\nOutput:\nYes\nNo\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

This year, N students attended the entrance exams, but no more than K will enter the university. In order to decide who are these students, there are series of entrance exams. All the students with score strictly greater than at least (N-K) students' total score gets enrolled.\nIn total there are E entrance exams, in each of them one can score between 0 and M points, inclusively. The first E-1 exams had already been conducted, and now it's time for the last tribulation.\nSergey is the student who wants very hard to enter the university, so he had collected the information about the first E-1 from all N-1 enrollees (i.e., everyone except him). Of course, he knows his own scores as well.\nIn order to estimate his chances to enter the University after the last exam, Sergey went to a fortune teller. From the visit, he learnt about scores that everyone except him will get at the last exam. Now he wants to calculate the minimum score he needs to score in order to enter to the university. But now he's still very busy with minimizing the amount of change he gets in the shops, so he asks you to help him.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains four space separated integers N, K, E, M denoting the number of students, the maximal number of students who'll get enrolled, the total number of entrance exams and maximal number of points for a single exam, respectively.\nThe following N-1 lines will contain E integers each, where the first E-1 integers correspond to the scores of the exams conducted. The last integer corresponds to the score at the last exam, that was predicted by the fortune-teller.\nThe last line contains E-1 integers denoting Sergey's score for the first E-1 exams.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the minimum score Sergey should get in the last exam in order to be enrolled. If Sergey doesn't have a chance to be enrolled, output \"Impossible\" (without quotes).\n\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 5\n1 \u2264 K < N \u2264 10^4\n1 \u2264 M \u2264 10^9\n1 \u2264 E \u2264 4\n\n\nExample\nInput:\n1\n4 2 3 10\n7 7 7\n4 6 10\n7 10 9\n9 9\n\nOutput:\n4\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1. If Sergey gets 4 points at the last exam, his score will be equal to 9+9+4=22. This will be the second score among all the enrollees - the first one will get 21, the second one will get 20 and the third will have the total of 26. Thus, Sergey will enter the university.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

Yes, you read that right. Large spoons suspended in the atmosphere. \n Noodle decides the following strategy to implement his idea. He will deploy exactly N spoons in the country. Every spoon can cater to as many cities as it wants. The only catch is that between every pair of  spoons A and B,  A must cater to at-least one city that B doesn't cater to, and  B  must cater to at-least one city that A doesn't cater to. \n Noodle would like to know what is the minimum number of cities a country must have for his strategy to be successful.

Click here to read it. \nThe following problem appeared in the CodeChef March '09 Challenge\nIn the mysterious country of Byteland, everything is quite different from what you'd \n\nnormally expect. In most places, if you were approached by two mobsters in a dark alley, they would \n\nprobably tell you to give them all the money that you have. If you refused, or didn't have any - \n\nthey might even beat you up.\n\nIn Byteland the government decided that even the slightest chance of someone getting injured has to be ruled out. So, they introduced a strict policy. When a mobster approaches you in a dark \n\nalley, he asks you for a specific amount of money. You are obliged to show him all the money that \n\nyou have, but you only need to pay up if he can find a subset of your banknotes whose total value \n\nmatches his demand. Since banknotes in Byteland can have any positive integer value smaller than \n\none thousand you are quite likely to get off without paying.\n\nBoth the citizens and the gangsters of Byteland have very positive feelings about the system. No one ever \n\ngets hurt, the gangsters don't lose their jobs, and there are quite a few rules that minimize that \nprobability of getting mugged (the first one is: don't go into dark alleys - and this one is said to work in other places also).\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains integer t, the number of test cases (about 100). Then t test cases follow. Each test case starts with n, the \n\nnumber of banknotes in your wallet, and m, the amount of money the muggers asked of you. Then n \n\nnumbers follow, representing values of your banknotes. Your wallet does not hold more than 20 banknotes, and the value of a single banknote is never more than 1000.\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case output a single line with the word 'Yes' if there is a subset of your banknotes that sums  to m, and 'No' otherwise.\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n5\n3 3\n1\n1\n1\n5 11\n1\n2\n4\n8\n16\n5 23\n1\n2\n4\n8\n16\n5 13\n1\n5\n5\n10\n10\n20 132\n17\n6\n4\n998\n254\n137\n259\n153\n154\n3\n28\n19\n123\n542\n857\n23\n687\n35\n99\n999\n\nOutput:\nYes\nYes\nYes\nNo\nYes\n\n\nExplanation: For example, in the last case you have to pay up, since: 6+3+123=132.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

A wooden chest containing N coins! But as you should remember, Tuzik is just a little dog, and so he can't open it by himself. Actually, the only thing he can really do is barking. He can use his barking to attract nearby people and seek their help. He can set the loudness of his barking very precisely, and therefore you can assume that he can choose to call any number of people, from a minimum of 1, to a maximum of K.\nWhen people come and open the chest they divide all the coins between them in such a way that everyone will get the same amount of coins and this amount is maximal possible.

        "prompt": "### Prompt\nProblem Statement\nLittle Elephant from Zoo of Lviv likes bamboo very much. He currently has n stems of bamboo, Hi - height of i-th stem of bamboo (0-based numeration). \n\nToday inspector Andrii from World Bamboo Association is visiting the plantation. He doesn't like current situation. He wants the height of i-th stem to be Di, for each i from 0 to n-1, inclusive.\n\nLittle Elephant is going to buy some special substance. One bottle of such substance he can use to single stem of bamboo. After using substance for stem i, the height of i-th stem is decrased by 1 and the height of j-th stem is increased by 1 for each j not equal to i. Note that it is possible for some of the stems to have negative height, but after all transformations all stems should have positive height.\n\nSubstance is very expensive. Help Little Elephant and find the minimal number of bottles of substance required for changing current plantation to one that inspector wants. If it's impossible, print -1.\n\n\nInput\nFirst line contain single integer T - the number of test cases. T test cases follow. First line of each test case contains single integer n - the number of stems in the plantation. Second line contains n integers separated by single space - starting plantation. Next line of each test case contains n integers - plantation that inspector Andrii requires.\n\n\nOutput\nIn T lines print T integers - the answers for the corresponding test cases.\n\n\nConstraints\n\n1 <= T <= 50\n\n1 <= n <= 50\n\n1 <= Hi, Di <= 50\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n3\n1\n1\n2\n2\n1 2\n2 1\n3\n3 2 2\n4 5 3\n\n\nOutput:\n-1\n1\n5\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",
