Of course, these transceivers have a limited range so if two are too far apart, they cannot communicate directly.\n\n\nThe Chef invested in top-of-the-line transceivers which have a few advanced features. One is that even if two people cannot talk directly because they are out of range, if there is another transceiver that is close enough to both, then the two transceivers can still communicate with each other using the third transceiver as an intermediate device.\n\n\nThere has been a minor emergency in the Chef's restaurant\nand he needs to communicate with both the head server and the sous-chef right away. Help the Chef determine if it is possible for all three people to communicate with each other, even if two must communicate through the third because they are too far apart.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single positive integer T \u2264 100 indicating the number of test cases to follow. The first line of each test case contains a positive integer R \u2264 1,000 indicating that two transceivers can communicate directly without an intermediate transceiver if they are at most R meters away from each other. The remaining three lines of the test case describe the current locations of the Chef, the head server, and the sous-chef, respectively. Each such line contains two integers X,Y (at most 10,000 in absolute value) indicating that the respective person is located at position X,Y.\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case you are to output a single line containing a single string. If it is possible for all three to communicate then you should output \"yes\". Otherwise, you should output \"no\".\n\n\nTo be clear, we say that two transceivers are close enough to communicate directly if the length of the straight line connecting their X,Y coordinates is at most R.\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n3\n1\n0 1\n0 0\n1 0\n2\n0 1\n0 0\n1 0\n2\n0 0\n0 2\n2 1\n\n\nOutput:\nyes\nyes\nno\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

For example, the string S = 7477447 is balanced since S[1, 4] = 7477 has 1 digit 4 and S[5, 7] = 447 has 1 digit 7. On the other hand, one can verify that the string S = 7 is not balanced.\n The Little Elephant has the string S of the length N. He wants to know the number of such pairs of integers (L; R) that 1 \u2264 L \u2264 R \u2264 N and the substring S[L, R]  is balanced. Help him to find this number.\nNotes.\n\nLet S be some lucky string.

For example, if the initial sequence is (3, 5, 1, 6, 4, 2) and after one shuffle Johnny gets (1, 2, 5, 4, 3, 6) he will fix 1, 2 and 6 and proceed with sorting (5, 4, 3) using the same algorithm.

So, for first three months, he will redeem 200 * 3 = 600 laddus. The remaining 169 laddus, he can not redeem as he requires at least 200 laddues in a month to redeem. \nSo, answer is 3.\n\nIn the second example, user is a non-Indian user, he can redeem 400 laddues per month. So, in the first month, he will redeem 400 laddus. The remaining 369 laddus, he can not redeem as he requires at least 400 laddues in a month to redeem. \nSo, answer is 1.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

For a regular player the look of the field seems pretty random, but the programmer in you recognizes the following pattern: the i-th cell on the n-th row contains C(n, i) coins if and only if 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n, all other cells are blocked. Record C(n, i) denotes binomial coefficient \"n choose i\".\nThe player starts from the cell situated at row R and column C in the matrix. The objective is to collect exactly G number of coins from matrix in several moves. There are some rules: \n\nOn each move the player must collect all the coins from some unblocked cell in the current column.\nThe rules of the game state, that player mustn't be really greedy, so the number of coins he collected must not increase. In other words, if at some move the player collected X coins then further he cannot collect more than X coins in a single move.\nAfter each move, the player is immediately moved to some cell of the column W-1 (where W denotes the current column of the player).

Recall that a palindrome is a string that reads the same left to right as right to left (as in \"radar\").\n\n\nFor example:\n\nFor N = 1, we have 26 different palindromes of length not exceeding N: \"a\", \"b\", ..., \"z\".\nFor N = 2 we have 52 different palindromes of length not exceeding N: \"a\", \"b\", ..., \"z\", \"aa\", \"bb\", ..., \"zz\".\nFor N = 3 we have 728 different palindromes of length not exceeding N: \"a\", \"b\", ..., \"z\", \"aa\", \"bb\", ..., \"zz\", \"aaa\", \"aba\", ..., \"aza\", \"bab\", \"bbb\", ..., \"bzb\", ..., \"zaz\", \"zbz\", ..., \"zzz\".\n\n\nSince the answer can be quite large you should output it modulo 1000000007 (10^9 + 7).

But be careful, some of the routes are incorrect. There may be some misspelling in city names or there will be no road between some two consecutive cities in the route. Also note that Chef hates to visit the same city twice during his travel. Even the last city should differ from the first. Two consecutive cities in the route should also be different. So you need to check these conditions for the given routes too.\n\nYou will be given the list of all cities and all roads between them with their lengths. All roads are one-way. Also you will be given the list of all travel routes that Chef plans. For each route you should check whether it is correct and find its length in this case.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains positive integer N, the number of cities. The second line contains space separated list of N strings, city names. All city names are distinct.\n\nThe third line contains non-negative integer M, the number of available roads. Each of the next M lines describes one road and contains names C1 and C2 of two cities followed by the positive integer D, the length of the one-way road that connects C1 with C2. It is guaranteed that C1 and C2 will be correct names of two different cities from the list of N cities given in the second line of the input file. For each pair of different cities there is at most one road in each direction and each road will be described exactly once in the input file.\n\nNext line contains positive integer T, the number of travel routes planned by the Chef.

Note that a route composed of exactly one city is always correct provided that city name is written correctly. \nThe 11^th route is incorrect since there is no cities with names Mumbai and Deli. (Probably Chef is not so good in geography :)) \nThe 12^th route is incorrect since city New-York is visited twice. \nFinally the 13^th route is incorrect since we have equal consecutive cities.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

He went to watch this year's Indian Grand Prix at New Delhi. He noticed that one segment of the circuit was a long straight road. It was impossible for a car to overtake other cars on this segment. Therefore, a car had to lower down its speed if there was a slower car in front of it. While watching the race, Chef started to wonder how many cars were moving at their maximum speed.\nFormally, you're given the maximum speed of N cars in the order they entered the long straight segment of the circuit. Each car prefers to move at its maximum speed. If that's not possible because of the front car being slow, it might have to lower its speed. It still moves at the fastest possible speed while avoiding any collisions. For the purpose of this problem, you can assume that the straight segment is infinitely long.\nCount the number of cars which were moving at their maximum speed on the straight segment.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases to follow.

This way, only the root has the level equal to 1, while only its two sons has the level equal to 2.\nThen, let's take all the nodes with the odd level and enumerate them with consecutive odd numbers, starting from the smallest levels and the leftmost nodes, going to the rightmost nodes and the highest levels.\nThen, let's take all the nodes with the even level and enumerate them with consecutive even numbers, starting from the smallest levels and the leftmost nodes, going to the rightmost nodes and the highest levels.\nFor the better understanding there is an example: \n\n\n                             1\n                        /           \\\n                  2                   4\n                /   \\                /       \\\n             3       5           7        9\n            / \\      /  \\          /  \\       /  \\\n           6  8 10 12      14 16   18 20 \nHere you can see the visualization of the process.

The same is the case with right side. \nA connection between two spots requires a wire of length equal to the distance between the two.\n\n\nThe realm has already purchased a wire of M miles long from Nokia, \npossibly the wire will be cut into smaller length wires. \nAs we can observe, the total length of the used wire depends on the permutation of the spots P. Help the realm in minimizing the length of the unused wire. If there is not enough wire, output -1.\n\n\nInput\nFirst line contains an integer T (number of test cases, 1 \u2264 T \u2264 10 ).

The Galactik Football Assosiation (GFA) has announced a football tournament between all the teams of all the planets in the galaxy (say N). Teams like Snow Kids, Shadows, Xenons, Red Tigers, Wambas, Pirates, etc. are in total enthusiasm and are practising hard to win the cup using their talent and flux.\nEach planet of the galaxy has a government. Some governments have a mutual agreement between them. If planet A has mutual agreement with planet B, then there is a bidirectional spaceway between A and B using which anybody can go from A to B and vice-versa. People can use these spaceways to travel from one planet to another, if there exists a path between them using some of the spaceways.\nEach planet has it's own football ground. The GFA has planned the matches in such a way that a team can have a match at any of these grounds. The GFA has come across some problems in the execution of their plan. They have found out that there are many pairs of planets between which there does not exist any path, so the football team of one of those planets can't reach the other planet. They requested the corresponding governments to make a spaceway between them, but because of absense of mutual agreement (duhhh.. Politics!), these goverment did not agree. So the GFA suggested that they will make teleports between some pairs of planets which will be used only by the football teams to travel.\nBut there are two types of governments in the galaxy\n1. Some of the governments are greedy (duhhh..). They want to make money (You don't say!) throught the GFA. So each of these government has asked the GFA for a tax value which it has to pay if it wants to make a teleport ending at their planet.\n2. Others want to sponser the event, so they will give money to the GFA if they make a teleport ending at their planet (That's new..). The GFA would always avoid such governments no matter what the consequences are, because these kind of governments have always some dirty plans in their minds for the GFA.\nNow, the GFA wants to make bi-directional teleports between planets such that the football teams of any planet can reach any other planet to play a football match, using spaceways between the planets and/or teleports made by the GFA.\nThe GFA also has financial problems and want to spend as little money as possible. They have come to you so that you can help them calculate the minimum ammount of money needed to fulfill their plan.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input consists of two integers - N and M. N is number of planets and M is number of pairs of planets which have a mutual agreement, i.e they have a spaceway between them. Then, M lines follow, each containing two space separated integers A and B, denoting a mutual agreement and hence a spaceway to travel, between plenet A and planet B. Then, N lines follow. The i^th line has an integer C. If C \u2265 0, then it represents the tax value which the GFA has to pay to the government of planet i (it's a type 1 government). If C < 0, then it represents the money the ith government will pay to the GFA (it's a type 2 government).\n\nOutput\nPrint the minimum amount needed for the GFA to fulfill their plan if it can be fulfilled, else print \"-1\" (without quotes).\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 100,000\n0 \u2264 M \u2264 1,000,000\n0 \u2264 |C| \u2264 10,000\n1 \u2264 A,B \u2264 N\nA \u2260 B\n\nSample\n\nInput 1\n6 6\n1 2\n2 3\n1 3\n4 5\n5 6\n4 6\n1\n3\n5\n2\n4\n6\n\nOutput 1\n3\n\n\nInput 2\n3 1\n2 3\n1\n-1\n-1\n\nOutput 2\n-1\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

        "prompt": "### Prompt\nThe Little Elephant loves lucky strings. Everybody knows that the lucky string is a string of digits that contains only the lucky digits 4 and 7. For example, strings \"47\", \"744\", \"4\" are lucky while \"5\", \"17\", \"467\" are not.\n\n\nThe Little Elephant has the strings A and B of digits. These strings are of equal lengths, that is |A| = |B|. He wants to get some lucky string from them. For this he performs the following operations. At first he arbitrary reorders digits of A. Then he arbitrary reorders digits of B. After that he creates the string C such that its i-th digit is the maximum between the i-th digit of A and the i-th digit of B. In other words, C[i] = max{A[i], B[i]} for i from 1 to |A|. After that he removes from C all non-lucky digits saving the order of the remaining (lucky) digits. So C now becomes a lucky string. For example, if after reordering A = \"754\" and B = \"873\", then C is at first \"874\" and then it becomes \"74\".\n\n\nThe Little Elephant wants the resulting string to be as lucky as possible. The formal definition of this is that the resulting string should be the lexicographically greatest possible string among all the strings that can be obtained from the given strings A and B by the described process.\n\nNotes\n\n|A| denotes the length of the string A.\nA[i] denotes the i-th digit of the string A. Here we numerate the digits starting from 1. So 1 \u2264 i \u2264 |A|.\nThe string A is called lexicographically greater than the string B if either there exists some index i such that A[i] > B[i] and for each j < i we have A[j] = B[j], or B is a proper prefix of A, that is, |A| > |B| and first |B| digits of A coincide with the corresponding digits of B.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains the string A. The second line contains the string B.\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case output a single line containing the answer for the corresponding test case. Note, that the answer can be an empty string. In this case you should print an empty line for the corresponding test case.\n\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 10000\n1 \u2264 |A| \u2264 20000\n|A| = |B|\nEach character of A and B is a digit.\nSum of |A| across all the tests in the input does not exceed 200000.\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n4\n4\n7\n435\n479\n7\n8\n1675475\n9756417\n\nOutput:\n7\n74\n\n777744\n\n\nExplanation\n\nCase 1. In this case the only possible string C we can get is \"7\" and it is the lucky string.\n\n\nCase 2. If we reorder A and B as A = \"543\" and B = \"749\" the string C will be at first \"749\" and then becomes \"74\". It can be shown that this is the lexicographically greatest string for the given A and B.\n\n\nCase 3. In this case the only possible string C we can get is \"8\" and it becomes and empty string after removing of non-lucky digits.\n\n\nCase 4. If we reorder A and B as A = \"7765541\" and B = \"5697714\" the string C will be at first \"7797744\" and then becomes \"777744\". Note that we can construct any lexicographically greater string for the given A and B since we have only four \"sevens\" and two \"fours\" among digits of both strings A and B as well the constructed string \"777744\".\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

Digory's Uncle Andrew has been secretly doing strange things in the attic of his house, and he always ensures that the room is locked. Being curious, Digory suspects that there is another route into the attic through Polly's house, and being curious as kids always are, they wish to find out what it is that Uncle Andrew is secretly up to.\n\n\nSo they start from Polly's house, and walk along the passageway to Digory's. Unfortunately, along the way, they suddenly find that some of the floorboards are missing, and that taking a step forward would have them plummet to their deaths below.\n\n\nDejected, but determined, they return to Polly's house, and decide to practice long-jumping in the yard before they re-attempt the crossing of the passage. It takes them exactly one day to master long-jumping a certain length. Also, once they have mastered jumping a particular length L, they are able to jump any amount less than equal to L as well.\n\n\nThe next day they return to their mission, but somehow find that there is another place further up the passage, that requires them to jump even more than they had practiced for. So they go back and repeat the process.\n\n\nNote the following:\n\n At each point, they are able to sense only how much they need to jump at that point, and have no idea of the further reaches of the passage till they reach there. That is, they are able to only see how far ahead is the next floorboard. \n The amount they choose to practice for their jump is exactly the amount they need to get across that particular part of the passage. That is, if they can currently jump upto a length L0, and they require to jump a length L1(> L0) at that point, they will practice jumping length L1 that day. \n They start by being able to \"jump\" a length of 1. \n\n\nFind how many days it will take them to cross the passageway. In the input, the passageway is described as a string P of '#'s and '.'s. A '#' represents a floorboard, while a '.' represents the absence of a floorboard. The string, when read from left to right, describes the passage from Polly's house to Digory's, and not vice-versa.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line consists of a single integer T, the number of testcases.\nEach of the next T lines consist of the string P for that case.\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each case, output the number of days it takes them to cross the passage.\n\n\nConstraints\n\n 1  \u2264 T  \u2264 1,000,000  (10^6)\n 1  \u2264 |P|  \u2264 1,000,000 (10^6)\n The total length of P will be \u2264 5,000,000 (5 * 10^6)across all test-cases of a test-file \n P will consist of only the characters # and . \n The first and the last characters of P will be #. \n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n4\n####\n##.#..#\n##..#.#\n##.#....#\n\nOutput:\n0\n2\n1\n2\n\nExplanation\n\nFor the first example, they do not need to learn any jump size. They are able to cross the entire passage by \"jumping\" lengths 1-1-1.\n\n\nFor the second example case, they get stuck at the first '.', and take one day learning to jump length 2. When they come back the next day, they get stuck at '..' and take one day to learn to jump length 3.\n\n\nFor the third example case, they get stuck first at '..', and they take one day to learn to jump length 3. On the second day, they are able to jump both length 3 as well as length 2 required to cross the passage.\n\n\nFor the last test case they need to stop and learn jumping two times. At first they need to jump a length 2 and then a length 5.\n\n\nAppendix\n\nIrrelevant to the problem description, if you're curious about what Uncle Andrew was up to, he was experimenting on Magic Rings that could facilitate travel between worlds.

You always end up at (2, 2), so P[2][2] is 1. Required sum = 1.0 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 1.0 = 3.0\nExample case 2\nProbability matrix P for N=1, M=6 is\n1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0\nBecause at any position there is only one possible next position.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

If you have A dollars and B cents remaining in your purse after depositing the C cents, then after the transformation you will have B dollars and A cents. You can repeat this procedure as many times as you want unless you don't have enough money for the machine. If at any point C > B and A > 0, then the machine will allow you to break one of the A dollars into 100 cents so you can place C cents in the machine. The machine will not allow you to exchange a dollar for 100 cents if B >= C.\n \nOf course, you want to do this to maximize your profit. For example if C=69 and you have 9 dollars and 77 cents then after you put 69 cents in the machine you will have 8 dollars and 9 cents (9.77 --> 9.08 --> 8.09). But I should warn you that you can't cheat. If you try to throw away 9 cents before the transformation (in order to obtain 99 dollars and 8 cents after), the machine will sense you are cheating and take away all of your money. You need to know how many times you should do this transformation in order to make a maximum profit. Since you are very busy man, you want to obtain the maximum possible profit in the minimum amount of time.\n\n\nInput\n The first line contains a single integer T <= 40, the number of test cases.

In this situation, variables are also known as unknowns and the values which satisfy the equality are known as solutions. An equation differs from an identity in that an equation is not necessarily true for all possible values of the variable.\nThere are many types of equations, and they are found in all areas of mathematics. For instance, a linear equation is an algebraic equation in which each term is either a constant or the product of a constant and (the first power of) a single variable.\nIn this problem we'll consider quite a special kind of systems of linear equations.

Your task is to find the solution of the system(such a sequence x1, x2, ..., xN, that turns each of the equations into equality).

At first he needs to write the module that will receive moves written by the players and analyze it. The module will receive a string and it should report at first whether this string represents the correct pair of cells on the chess board (we call such strings correct) and then report whether it represents the correct move depending on the situation on the chess board. Chef always has troubles with analyzing knight moves. So at first he needs a test program that can say whether a given string is correct and then whether it represents a correct knight move (irregardless of the situation on the chess board). The cell on the chessboard is represented as a string of two characters: first character is a lowercase Latin letter from a to h and the second character is a digit from 1 to 8. The string represents the correct pair of cells on the chess board if it composed of 5 characters where first two characters represent the cell where chess figure was, 3rd character is the dash \"-\" and the last two characters represent the destination cell.\n\n\nInput\n The first line contains a single integer T <= 50000, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The only line of each test case contains a non-empty string composed the characters with ASCII-codes from 32 to 126. The length of the string is not greater than 10.\n\n\nOutput\n For each test case, output a single line containing the word \"Error\" if the corresponding string does not represent the correct pair of cells on the chess board. Otherwise output \"Yes\" if this pair of cells represents the correct knight move and \"No\" otherwise.\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n4\na1-b3\nd2-h8\na3 c4\nErrorError\n\nOutput:\nYes\nNo\nError\nError\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

So, he is going to experiment by pairing up some of his employees to see if the quality of the food prepared in his kitchen increases. However, only some pairs of employees are compatible. Two employees that are not compatible cannot be paired together.\n\n\nFor each pair of compatible employees, the Chef has assigned a number estimating how well the overall quality of the food might increase. Of course, each employee can only be paired with at most one other employee. Furthermore, it is ok to not pair some employees. So, your goal is to help the Chef decide how to pair the employees to maximize the total amount that the overall quality of food increases.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer denoting the number of test cases (at most 50). Each test case begins with two integers n and m. Here, n is the number of employees (between 2 and 1000) and m is the number of compatible pairs of employees (between 1 and 10,000). The employees are numbered from 0 to n-1. The next m lines describe a pair of compatible employees, one per line. The i'th such line contains two distinct integers ui,vi between 0 and n-1. Strangely enough, the Chef estimates that picking the i'th pair ui,vi will increase the quality of food prepared in his kitchen by exactly 2^i.\n\n\nNo pair of employees will be given more than once in the input. That is, for distinct indices i and j, we do not have both ui = uj and vi = vj, nor do we have both ui = vj and vi = uj.\n\n\nOutput\n\nThe output for each test case consists of the indices of the pairs of employees that are used in a maximum total value pairing (the indices are between 0 and m-1). These indices should be given in increasing order with a single space between consecutive numbers.

Then, the perfume spreads from one house (need not be inhabited by people) to all its adjacent houses in one second, and the cycle continues.

Let's assume that the first string is named S1, and the second S2. The unreadable symbols are specified with the question mark symbol '?'. The difference between the strings equals to the number of positions i, such that S1i is not equal to S2i, where S1i and S2i denote the symbol at the i the position in S1 and S2, respectively.\nChef would like to know the minimal and the maximal difference between the two strings, if he changes all unreadable symbols to lowercase Latin letters.

You can change the question marks in the strings so that you obtain S1 = abc and S2 = abb. Then S1 and S2 will differ in one position. On the other hand, you can change the letters so that S1 = abc and S2 = bab. Then, the strings will differ in all three positions.\nExample case 2. Change the question marks this way: S1 = dcba, S2 = dcba, then the strings will differ in 0 positions. You can also change the question marks so that S1 = aaaa, S2 = dcba, then the strings will differ in 3 positions.\nExample case 3. Change the question marks this way: S1 = aabac, S2 = abaaw, then the strings will differ in 3 positions. Then, change the question marks this way: S1 = xabac, S2 = abayw, then they will differ in 5 positions.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

In this situation, Chef can make them equal by giving 1 pack of 10 to Alvin and 2 packs of 3 to Berto, so they now have 1 + 10 = 5 + 3 + 3 = 11 candies each.\nExample case 2. In this test case, Alvin has 1 candy and Berto has 2. The apple and banana candies come in packs of 2. In this situation, the number of candies of Alvin is always odd, and the number of candies of Berto is always even, so Chef cannot make them equal.

So he wants to know the minimum number of operations needed to make all the piles equal.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of piles.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the number of coins in each pile.\n\n\nOutput\n\n\nFor each test case, output a single line containing an integer corresponding to the minimum number of operations assistant needs to do.\n\n\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 10\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 10^5\n1 \u2264 Ai \u2264 10^5\n\n\nSub tasks\n\nExample\nInput:\n1\n4\n1 2 3 4\n\nOutput:\n3\n\nExplanation\n\nIn test case 1, if you decide to convert all the piles to contain either of 1, 2, 3, or 4 coins you will have to change the other 3 piles. For any other choice you will have to alter more than 3 (i.e. 4) piles.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

Little Joe (uninvited) is curious to know how distant two people are, say X and Y.\nThere are 6 fundamental relations: father relation, mother relation, son relation, daughter relation, brother relation and sister relation. Using these fundamental relations we can describe all other relations between relatives. For example, one can say that Chef Prime is son of daughter of sister of father of father of Chef Composite.\nYou are given R relations of form \"A is F of B\", for N people from the party. There variable F is one of the following strings: father, mother, son, daughter, brother, sister. Also you are given Q queries of Little Joe, each query has form \"X Y\". For each query output the distance between persons X and Y. Distance is equal to the minimal number of fundamental relations appearing while describing the relation between X and Y. For example distance between Chef Prime and Chef Composite is 5. \nImportant points:\n1. Here brother (or sister) relation is considered between children of same parents only. Hence cousins are not considered brother (or sister) .\n2. Given relations meet all the following conditions:\n\nEach person has an unique name, and each name appears in at least one relation (as A, or as B).\nNo name appears more than once as the first part of relation (as A).\nThere is no cyclic relations. For example, the following relations cannot appear simultaneously in some testcase \"A is F1 of B\", \"B is F2 of C\" and \"C is F3 of A\".\n\n3. One can have at most one father and at most one mother. And in Chef's land no one takes divorce!\n4. Since you should calculate the minimal fundamental relations between some persons, you need to make some conclusion. For example, if X is father of Y, and Y is brother of Z, then X is father of Z.\n\nInput\nThe first line contains two integers N, number of people, and R, number of relations. Then R lines follow. Each line contains a relation of form \"A is F of B\".\nThe next line contains integer Q, number of queries. Each of the next Q lines contains two space-separated strings X and Y, denoting the query of the Little Joe.

To help you understand his requirements we'll introduce the pseudocode of function F(S):\n\n\n\tFUNCTION F( S - a valid parentheses sequence )\n\tBEGIN\n\t\tbalance = 0\n\t\tmax_balance = 0\n\t\tFOR index FROM 1 TO LENGTH(S)\n\t\tBEGIN\n\t\t\tif S[index] == '(' then balance = balance + 1\n\t\t\tif S[index] == ')' then balance = balance - 1\n\t\t\tmax_balance = max( max_balance, balance )\n\t\tEND\n\t\tRETURN max_balance\n\tEND\n\n\tIn other words, F(S) is equal to the maximal balance over all prefixes of S.\n\n\n\tLet's denote A as Mike's current parentheses sequence, and B as a candidate for a new one. Mike is willing to replace A with B if F(A) is equal to F(B). He would also like to choose B with the minimal possible length amongst ones satisfying the previous condition. If there are several such strings with the minimal possible length, then Mike will choose the least one lexicographically, considering '(' to be less than ')'.\n\n\n\tHelp Mike!\n\n\nInput\n\n\tThe first line of the input contains one integer T denoting the number of testcases to process.\n\n\n\tThe only line of each testcase contains one string A denoting Mike's parentheses sequence. It is guaranteed that A only consists of the characters '(' and ')'. It is also guaranteed that A is a valid parentheses sequence.\n\n\nOutput\n\n\tThe output should contain exactly T lines, one line per each testcase in the order of their appearance. The only line of each testcase should contain one string B denoting the valid parentheses sequence that should be chosen by Mike to replace A.\n\n\nConstraints\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 5;\n1 \u2264 |A| \u2264 100000(10^5).\n\nExample\nInput:\n1\n()((()()))\n\nOutput:\n((()))\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

        "prompt": "### Prompt\nLittle Egor likes to play with positive integers and their divisors. Bigger the number to play with, more the fun! The boy asked you to come up with an algorithm, that could play the following game: \nLet's define f(n) as the sum of all odd divisors of n. I.e. f(10) = 1 + 5 = 6 and f(21) = 1 + 3 + 7 + 21 = 32. The game is to calculate f(l) + f(l + 1) + ... + f(r - 1) + f(r) for the given integers l and r.\nHave fun! But be careful, the integers might be quite big.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains one integer T denoting the number of test cases.\nThe only line of the test case description contains two positive integers l and r.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output the required sum on a separate line.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 10\n1 \u2264 l \u2264 r \u2264 10^5\n\n\nExample\nInput:\n2\n1 10\n42 42\n\nOutput:\n45\n32\n\nExplanation\nIn the first example case, f(1) + f(2) + ... + f(10) = 1 + 1 + 4 + 1 + 6 + 4 + 8 + 1 + 13 + 6 = 45\nIn the second example case, f(42) = 32.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",
