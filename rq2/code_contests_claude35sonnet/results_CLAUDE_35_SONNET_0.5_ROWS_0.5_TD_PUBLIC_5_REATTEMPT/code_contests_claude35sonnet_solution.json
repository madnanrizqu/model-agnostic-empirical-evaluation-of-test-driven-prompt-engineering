Of course, these transceivers have a limited range so if two are too far apart, they cannot communicate directly.\n\n\nThe Chef invested in top-of-the-line transceivers which have a few advanced features. One is that even if two people cannot talk directly because they are out of range, if there is another transceiver that is close enough to both, then the two transceivers can still communicate with each other using the third transceiver as an intermediate device.\n\n\nThere has been a minor emergency in the Chef's restaurant\nand he needs to communicate with both the head server and the sous-chef right away. Help the Chef determine if it is possible for all three people to communicate with each other, even if two must communicate through the third because they are too far apart.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single positive integer T \u2264 100 indicating the number of test cases to follow. The first line of each test case contains a positive integer R \u2264 1,000 indicating that two transceivers can communicate directly without an intermediate transceiver if they are at most R meters away from each other. The remaining three lines of the test case describe the current locations of the Chef, the head server, and the sous-chef, respectively. Each such line contains two integers X,Y (at most 10,000 in absolute value) indicating that the respective person is located at position X,Y.\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case you are to output a single line containing a single string. If it is possible for all three to communicate then you should output \"yes\". Otherwise, you should output \"no\".\n\n\nTo be clear, we say that two transceivers are close enough to communicate directly if the length of the straight line connecting their X,Y coordinates is at most R.\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n3\n1\n0 1\n0 0\n1 0\n2\n0 1\n0 0\n1 0\n2\n0 0\n0 2\n2 1\n\n\nOutput:\nyes\nyes\nno\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

For example, the string S = 7477447 is balanced since S[1, 4] = 7477 has 1 digit 4 and S[5, 7] = 447 has 1 digit 7. On the other hand, one can verify that the string S = 7 is not balanced.\n The Little Elephant has the string S of the length N. He wants to know the number of such pairs of integers (L; R) that 1 \u2264 L \u2264 R \u2264 N and the substring S[L, R]  is balanced. Help him to find this number.\nNotes.\n\nLet S be some lucky string. Then\n\n\n|S| denotes the length of the string S;\n\nS[i] (1 \u2264 i \u2264 |S|) denotes the i^th character of S (the numeration of characters starts from 1);\n\n S[L, R] (1 \u2264 L \u2264 R \u2264 |S|) denotes the string with the following sequence of characters: S[L], S[L + 1], ..., S[R], and is called a substring of S. For L > R we mean by S[L, R] an empty string.\n\n\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input file contains a single integer T, the number of test cases.

As you may know this algorithm shuffles the sequence randomly until it is sorted. Johnny decided that we don't need to shuffle the whole sequence every time. If after the last shuffle several first elements end up in the right places we will fix them and don't shuffle those elements furthermore. We will do the same for the last elements if they are in the right places. For example, if the initial sequence is (3, 5, 1, 6, 4, 2) and after one shuffle Johnny gets (1, 2, 5, 4, 3, 6) he will fix 1, 2 and 6 and proceed with sorting (5, 4, 3) using the same algorithm. Johnny hopes that this optimization will significantly improve the algorithm. Help him calculate the expected amount of shuffles for the improved algorithm to sort the sequence of the first n natural numbers given that no elements are in the right places initially.\n\nInput\nThe first line of input file is number t - the number of test cases.

So, for first three months, he will redeem 200 * 3 = 600 laddus. The remaining 169 laddus, he can not redeem as he requires at least 200 laddues in a month to redeem. \nSo, answer is 3.\n\nIn the second example, user is a non-Indian user, he can redeem 400 laddues per month. So, in the first month, he will redeem 400 laddus. The remaining 369 laddus, he can not redeem as he requires at least 400 laddues in a month to redeem. \nSo, answer is 1.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

He went to watch this year's Indian Grand Prix at New Delhi. He noticed that one segment of the circuit was a long straight road. It was impossible for a car to overtake other cars on this segment. Therefore, a car had to lower down its speed if there was a slower car in front of it. While watching the race, Chef started to wonder how many cars were moving at their maximum speed.\nFormally, you're given the maximum speed of N cars in the order they entered the long straight segment of the circuit. Each car prefers to move at its maximum speed. If that's not possible because of the front car being slow, it might have to lower its speed. It still moves at the fastest possible speed while avoiding any collisions. For the purpose of this problem, you can assume that the straight segment is infinitely long.\nCount the number of cars which were moving at their maximum speed on the straight segment.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases to follow.

In how many ways, can I choose K elements from the class to sit down, if I see them as being distinct?\" \nLira replied immediately with the right answer, so, the teacher decided to make the game a little funnier: \"Okay Lira, as you are so fast, now I want you to tell me exactly the same thing, but, with the addition that the value of K is changing, this is, I want you to tell me the sum of the number of ways I can sit down K of you, if the value of K goes from 1 (meaning that there are no chairs in the classroom but one) to N (meaning that all of your chairs arrived). Can you be as fast now? As the answer might get large I want you to tell me the result modulo 1000000007.

The Galactik Football Assosiation (GFA) has announced a football tournament between all the teams of all the planets in the galaxy (say N). Teams like Snow Kids, Shadows, Xenons, Red Tigers, Wambas, Pirates, etc. are in total enthusiasm and are practising hard to win the cup using their talent and flux.\nEach planet of the galaxy has a government. Some governments have a mutual agreement between them. If planet A has mutual agreement with planet B, then there is a bidirectional spaceway between A and B using which anybody can go from A to B and vice-versa. People can use these spaceways to travel from one planet to another, if there exists a path between them using some of the spaceways.\nEach planet has it's own football ground. The GFA has planned the matches in such a way that a team can have a match at any of these grounds. The GFA has come across some problems in the execution of their plan. They have found out that there are many pairs of planets between which there does not exist any path, so the football team of one of those planets can't reach the other planet. They requested the corresponding governments to make a spaceway between them, but because of absense of mutual agreement (duhhh.. Politics!), these goverment did not agree. So the GFA suggested that they will make teleports between some pairs of planets which will be used only by the football teams to travel.\nBut there are two types of governments in the galaxy\n1. Some of the governments are greedy (duhhh..). They want to make money (You don't say!) throught the GFA. So each of these government has asked the GFA for a tax value which it has to pay if it wants to make a teleport ending at their planet.\n2. Others want to sponser the event, so they will give money to the GFA if they make a teleport ending at their planet (That's new..). The GFA would always avoid such governments no matter what the consequences are, because these kind of governments have always some dirty plans in their minds for the GFA.\nNow, the GFA wants to make bi-directional teleports between planets such that the football teams of any planet can reach any other planet to play a football match, using spaceways between the planets and/or teleports made by the GFA.\nThe GFA also has financial problems and want to spend as little money as possible. They have come to you so that you can help them calculate the minimum ammount of money needed to fulfill their plan.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input consists of two integers - N and M. N is number of planets and M is number of pairs of planets which have a mutual agreement, i.e they have a spaceway between them. Then, M lines follow, each containing two space separated integers A and B, denoting a mutual agreement and hence a spaceway to travel, between plenet A and planet B. Then, N lines follow. The i^th line has an integer C. If C \u2265 0, then it represents the tax value which the GFA has to pay to the government of planet i (it's a type 1 government). If C < 0, then it represents the money the ith government will pay to the GFA (it's a type 2 government).\n\nOutput\nPrint the minimum amount needed for the GFA to fulfill their plan if it can be fulfilled, else print \"-1\" (without quotes).\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 100,000\n0 \u2264 M \u2264 1,000,000\n0 \u2264 |C| \u2264 10,000\n1 \u2264 A,B \u2264 N\nA \u2260 B\n\nSample\n\nInput 1\n6 6\n1 2\n2 3\n1 3\n4 5\n5 6\n4 6\n1\n3\n5\n2\n4\n6\n\nOutput 1\n3\n\n\nInput 2\n3 1\n2 3\n1\n-1\n-1\n\nOutput 2\n-1\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

For example, strings \"47\", \"744\", \"4\" are lucky while \"5\", \"17\", \"467\" are not.\n\n\nThe Little Elephant has the strings A and B of digits. These strings are of equal lengths, that is |A| = |B|. He wants to get some lucky string from them. For this he performs the following operations. At first he arbitrary reorders digits of A. Then he arbitrary reorders digits of B. After that he creates the string C such that its i-th digit is the maximum between the i-th digit of A and the i-th digit of B. In other words, C[i] = max{A[i], B[i]} for i from 1 to |A|. After that he removes from C all non-lucky digits saving the order of the remaining (lucky) digits. So C now becomes a lucky string. For example, if after reordering A = \"754\" and B = \"873\", then C is at first \"874\" and then it becomes \"74\".\n\n\nThe Little Elephant wants the resulting string to be as lucky as possible. The formal definition of this is that the resulting string should be the lexicographically greatest possible string among all the strings that can be obtained from the given strings A and B by the described process.\n\nNotes\n\n|A| denotes the length of the string A.\nA[i] denotes the i-th digit of the string A. Here we numerate the digits starting from 1. So 1 \u2264 i \u2264 |A|.\nThe string A is called lexicographically greater than the string B if either there exists some index i such that A[i] > B[i] and for each j < i we have A[j] = B[j], or B is a proper prefix of A, that is, |A| > |B| and first |B| digits of A coincide with the corresponding digits of B.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. Each test case consists of two lines. The first line contains the string A. The second line contains the string B.\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case output a single line containing the answer for the corresponding test case. Note, that the answer can be an empty string.

In this case the only possible string C we can get is \"7\" and it is the lucky string.\n\n\nCase 2. If we reorder A and B as A = \"543\" and B = \"749\" the string C will be at first \"749\" and then becomes \"74\". It can be shown that this is the lexicographically greatest string for the given A and B.\n\n\nCase 3. In this case the only possible string C we can get is \"8\" and it becomes and empty string after removing of non-lucky digits.\n\n\nCase 4. If we reorder A and B as A = \"7765541\" and B = \"5697714\" the string C will be at first \"7797744\" and then becomes \"777744\". Note that we can construct any lexicographically greater string for the given A and B since we have only four \"sevens\" and two \"fours\" among digits of both strings A and B as well the constructed string \"777744\".\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

        "prompt": "### Prompt\nDigory Kirke and Polly Plummer are two kids living next door to each other. The attics of the two houses are connected to each other through a passage. Digory's Uncle Andrew has been secretly doing strange things in the attic of his house, and he always ensures that the room is locked. Being curious, Digory suspects that there is another route into the attic through Polly's house, and being curious as kids always are, they wish to find out what it is that Uncle Andrew is secretly up to.\n\n\nSo they start from Polly's house, and walk along the passageway to Digory's. Unfortunately, along the way, they suddenly find that some of the floorboards are missing, and that taking a step forward would have them plummet to their deaths below.\n\n\nDejected, but determined, they return to Polly's house, and decide to practice long-jumping in the yard before they re-attempt the crossing of the passage. It takes them exactly one day to master long-jumping a certain length. Also, once they have mastered jumping a particular length L, they are able to jump any amount less than equal to L as well.\n\n\nThe next day they return to their mission, but somehow find that there is another place further up the passage, that requires them to jump even more than they had practiced for. So they go back and repeat the process.\n\n\nNote the following:\n\n At each point, they are able to sense only how much they need to jump at that point, and have no idea of the further reaches of the passage till they reach there. That is, they are able to only see how far ahead is the next floorboard. \n The amount they choose to practice for their jump is exactly the amount they need to get across that particular part of the passage. That is, if they can currently jump upto a length L0, and they require to jump a length L1(> L0) at that point, they will practice jumping length L1 that day. \n They start by being able to \"jump\" a length of 1. \n\n\nFind how many days it will take them to cross the passageway. In the input, the passageway is described as a string P of '#'s and '.'s. A '#' represents a floorboard, while a '.' represents the absence of a floorboard. The string, when read from left to right, describes the passage from Polly's house to Digory's, and not vice-versa.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line consists of a single integer T, the number of testcases.\nEach of the next T lines consist of the string P for that case.\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each case, output the number of days it takes them to cross the passage.\n\n\nConstraints\n\n 1  \u2264 T  \u2264 1,000,000  (10^6)\n 1  \u2264 |P|  \u2264 1,000,000 (10^6)\n The total length of P will be \u2264 5,000,000 (5 * 10^6)across all test-cases of a test-file \n P will consist of only the characters # and . \n The first and the last characters of P will be #. \n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n4\n####\n##.#..#\n##..#.#\n##.#....#\n\nOutput:\n0\n2\n1\n2\n\nExplanation\n\nFor the first example, they do not need to learn any jump size. They are able to cross the entire passage by \"jumping\" lengths 1-1-1.\n\n\nFor the second example case, they get stuck at the first '.', and take one day learning to jump length 2. When they come back the next day, they get stuck at '..' and take one day to learn to jump length 3.\n\n\nFor the third example case, they get stuck first at '..', and they take one day to learn to jump length 3. On the second day, they are able to jump both length 3 as well as length 2 required to cross the passage.\n\n\nFor the last test case they need to stop and learn jumping two times. At first they need to jump a length 2 and then a length 5.\n\n\nAppendix\n\nIrrelevant to the problem description, if you're curious about what Uncle Andrew was up to, he was experimenting on Magic Rings that could facilitate travel between worlds. One such world, as some of you might have heard of, was Narnia.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

Today they want to play something new and came across Twitter on their father's laptop.\n\nThey saw it for the first time but were already getting bored to see a bunch of sentences having at most 140 characters each. The only thing they liked to play with it is, closing and opening tweets.\n\nThere are N tweets on the page and each tweet can be opened by clicking on it, to see some statistics related to that tweet. Initially all the tweets are closed. Clicking on an open tweet closes it and clicking on a closed tweet opens it. There is also a button to close all the open tweets. Given a sequence of K clicks by Jack, Evan has to guess the total number of open tweets just after each click. Please help Evan in this game.\n\n\nInput\nFirst line contains two integers N K, the number of tweets (numbered 1 to N) and the number of clicks respectively (1 \u2264 N, K \u2264 1000). Each of the following K lines has one of the following.\n\nCLICK X , where X is the tweet number (1 \u2264 X \u2264 N)\nCLOSEALL\n\n\n\nOutput\nOutput K lines, where the i^th line should contain the number of open tweets just after the i^th click.\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n3 6\nCLICK 1\nCLICK 2\nCLICK 3\nCLICK 2\nCLOSEALL\nCLICK 1\n\nOutput:\n1\n2\n3\n2\n0\n1\n\n\nExplanation:\nLet open[x] = 1 if the x^th tweet is open and 0 if its closed.\nInitially open[1..3] = { 0 , 0 , 0 }. Here is the state of open[1..3] after each click and corresponding count of open tweets.\nCLICK 1 : { 1, 0, 0 }, open count = 1\nCLICK 2 : { 1, 1, 0 }, open count = 2\nCLICK 3 : { 1, 1, 1 }, open count = 3\nCLICK 2 : { 1, 0, 1 }, open count = 2\nCLOSEALL : { 0, 0, 0 }, open count = 0\nCLICK 1 : { 1, 0, 0 }, open count = 1\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

Rows are numbered 1 to N, from top to bottom. Columns are numbered 1 to M, from left to right. You are initially at cell (1, 1) and want to go to cell (N, M). From any cell you can move to the cell below it or to the cell right to it. You should never go out of the grid. At any point you should consider all the possibilities of movement with equal probability\nLet P[i][j] be the probability of visiting cell (i, j). You need to calculate the sum of P[i][j] for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 N, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 M.\nAs we all know, Tojo really hates probability related problems. He wants you to solve this task\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.Only line of each test case has two integer N and M.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the required answer. Answers within an absolute or relative error of 10^-6 will be accepted.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 1000\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 1000\n1 \u2264 M \u2264 1000\n\n\nExample\nInput:\n2\n2 2\n1 6\n\nOutput:\n3.000000\n6.000000\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1\nProbability matrix P for N=2, M=2 is\n1.0 0.5\n0.5 1.0\nYou are at (1, 1) initially. So the probablity of visiting (1, 1) is 1. At (1, 1) you have 2 options, move below to (2, 1) or to right cell (1, 2). Probablity of going to (1, 2) is 0.5. Probability of going to (2, 1) is 0.5. You always end up at (2, 2), so P[2][2] is 1. Required sum = 1.0 + 0.5 + 0.5 + 1.0 = 3.0\nExample case 2\nProbability matrix P for N=1, M=6 is\n1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0\nBecause at any position there is only one possible next position.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

        "prompt": "### Prompt\nYou are standing near a very strange machine. If you put C cents in the machine, the remaining money in your purse will transform in an unusual way. If you have A dollars and B cents remaining in your purse after depositing the C cents, then after the transformation you will have B dollars and A cents. You can repeat this procedure as many times as you want unless you don't have enough money for the machine. If at any point C > B and A > 0, then the machine will allow you to break one of the A dollars into 100 cents so you can place C cents in the machine. The machine will not allow you to exchange a dollar for 100 cents if B >= C.\n \nOf course, you want to do this to maximize your profit. For example if C=69 and you have 9 dollars and 77 cents then after you put 69 cents in the machine you will have 8 dollars and 9 cents (9.77 --> 9.08 --> 8.09). But I should warn you that you can't cheat. If you try to throw away 9 cents before the transformation (in order to obtain 99 dollars and 8 cents after), the machine will sense you are cheating and take away all of your money. You need to know how many times you should do this transformation in order to make a maximum profit. Since you are very busy man, you want to obtain the maximum possible profit in the minimum amount of time.\n\n\nInput\n The first line contains a single integer T <= 40, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The only line of each test case contains three nonnegative integers A, B and C where A, B, C < 100. It means that you have A dollars and B cents in your purse and you need to put C cents in the machine to make the transformation.\n\n\nOutput\n For each test case, output a single line containing the minimal number of times you should do this transformation in order to make a maximal profit. It is guaranteed that the answer is less than 10000.\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n2\n9 77 69\n98 99 69\n\nOutput:\n4\n0\n\n\nExplanation\nIn the first test we have the following sequence: 9.77, 8.09, 40.07, 38.39, 70.37, 68.69, 0.68. After last step we have not enough money for further transformations. The maximal profit will be after 4 transformations.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

In this situation, variables are also known as unknowns and the values which satisfy the equality are known as solutions. An equation differs from an identity in that an equation is not necessarily true for all possible values of the variable.\nThere are many types of equations, and they are found in all areas of mathematics. For instance, a linear equation is an algebraic equation in which each term is either a constant or the product of a constant and (the first power of) a single variable.\nIn this problem we'll consider quite a special kind of systems of linear equations. To be more specific, you are given a system of N linear equations of the following form:\n\nx2 + x3 + ... + xN - 1 + xN = a1\nx1 + x3 + ... + xN - 1 + xN = a2\n...\nx1 + x2 + ... + xN - 2 + xN = aN - 1\nx1 + x2 + ... + xN - 2 + xN - 1 = aN\n\nIn other words, i'th equation of the system consists of the sum of all the variable x1, ..., xN except xi to the left of the equality sign and the constant ai to the right of the equality sign.\nOne can easily prove, that a system of linear equations as described above always have exactly one solution in case N is greater than one. Your task is to find the solution of the system(such a sequence x1, x2, ..., xN, that turns each of the equations into equality). It's guaranteed, that the solution of the system is a sequence consisting only of integers from the range [1, 10^8].\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of the test case description contains one integer N denoting the number of equations in the system.\nThe second line contains N integers a1, a2, ..., aN denoting the constants defining a system of linear equations, that you are asked to solve.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing N integers: a sequence x1, x2, ..., xN, which is the solution of the system.\n\nConstraints\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 25000\n2 \u2264 N \u2264 50000\n1 \u2264 ai \u2264 5 \u00d7 10^12\n1 \u2264 xi \u2264 10^8\nThe sum of all N in the input is not greater than 50000\n\nExample\nInput:\n2\n3\n9 6 5\n4\n13 11 10 8\n\nOutput:\n1 4 5 \n1 3 4 6 \n\n\nExplanation\n\n\tIn the first test case, we can simply replace the variables with the values from the correct output to make sure, that all the conditions are satisfied: \n\nx2 + x3 = 4 + 5 = 9 = a1\nx1 + x3 = 1 + 5 = 6 = a2\nx1 + x2 = 1 + 4 = 5 = a3\n\n\n\tIn the second test case, we can repeat the same process to make sure, that all the conditions are satisfied: \n\nx2 + x3 + x4 = 3 + 4 + 6 = 13 = a1\nx1 + x3 + x4 = 1 + 4 + 6 = 11 = a2\nx1 + x2 + x4 = 1 + 3 + 6 = 10 = a3\nx1 + x2 + x3 = 1 + 3 + 4 = 8 = a4\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

Chef always has troubles with analyzing knight moves. So at first he needs a test program that can say whether a given string is correct and then whether it represents a correct knight move (irregardless of the situation on the chess board). The cell on the chessboard is represented as a string of two characters: first character is a lowercase Latin letter from a to h and the second character is a digit from 1 to 8. The string represents the correct pair of cells on the chess board if it composed of 5 characters where first two characters represent the cell where chess figure was, 3rd character is the dash \"-\" and the last two characters represent the destination cell.\n\n\nInput\n The first line contains a single integer T <= 50000, the number of test cases.

So, he is going to experiment by pairing up some of his employees to see if the quality of the food prepared in his kitchen increases. However, only some pairs of employees are compatible. Two employees that are not compatible cannot be paired together.\n\n\nFor each pair of compatible employees, the Chef has assigned a number estimating how well the overall quality of the food might increase. Of course, each employee can only be paired with at most one other employee. Furthermore, it is ok to not pair some employees. So, your goal is to help the Chef decide how to pair the employees to maximize the total amount that the overall quality of food increases.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer denoting the number of test cases (at most 50). Each test case begins with two integers n and m. Here, n is the number of employees (between 2 and 1000) and m is the number of compatible pairs of employees (between 1 and 10,000). The employees are numbered from 0 to n-1. The next m lines describe a pair of compatible employees, one per line. The i'th such line contains two distinct integers ui,vi between 0 and n-1. Strangely enough, the Chef estimates that picking the i'th pair ui,vi will increase the quality of food prepared in his kitchen by exactly 2^i.\n\n\nNo pair of employees will be given more than once in the input. That is, for distinct indices i and j, we do not have both ui = uj and vi = vj, nor do we have both ui = vj and vi = uj.\n\n\nOutput\n\nThe output for each test case consists of the indices of the pairs of employees that are used in a maximum total value pairing (the indices are between 0 and m-1). These indices should be given in increasing order with a single space between consecutive numbers. If there is more than one possible output, then any will do.\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n2\n4 5\n0 1\n1 2\n2 3\n1 3\n3 0\n4 3\n0 1\n2 3\n2 1\n\nOutput:\n1 4\n2\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

Devu can put the perfume in at most one of the houses. This takes Devu one second. Then, the perfume spreads from one house (need not be inhabited by people) to all its adjacent houses in one second, and the cycle continues.

To make his business competitive he should interest customers. Now he knows how. But don't tell anyone -  it is a secret plan. Chef knows four national Ukrainian dishes - salo, borsch, varenyky and galushky. It is too few, of course, but enough for the beginning. Every day in his restaurant will be a dish of the day among these four ones. And dishes of the consecutive days must be different. To make the scheme more refined the dish of the first day and the dish of the last day must be different too. Now he wants his assistant to make schedule for some period. Chef suspects that there is more than one possible schedule. Hence he wants his assistant to prepare all possible plans so that he can choose the best one among them. He asks you for help. At first tell him how many such schedules exist. Since the answer can be large output it modulo 10^9 + 7, that is, you need to output the remainder of division of the actual answer by 10^9 + 7.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T, the number of test cases.

Don't be afraid. This time we will not provide you with a table of 240 schedules. The only thing we want to mention here is that apart from the previous two cases schedules for other values of N can have equal dishes (and even must have for N > 4). For example the schedule (salo, borsch, salo, borsch) is a correct schedule for N = 4 while the schedule (varenyky, salo, galushky, verynky, salo) is a correct schedule for N = 5.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

Vlad was the happiest man in the world! Now he can listen his favorite songs whenever he wants!\nVlad built up his own playlist. The playlist consists of N songs, each has a unique positive integer length. Vlad likes all the songs from his playlist, but there is a song, which he likes more than the others. It's named \"Uncle Johny\".\nAfter creation of the playlist, Vlad decided to sort the songs in increasing order of their lengths. For example, if the lengths of the songs in playlist was {1, 3, 5, 2, 4} after sorting it becomes {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Before the sorting, \"Uncle Johny\" was on K-th position (1-indexing is assumed for the playlist) in the playlist.\nVlad needs your help! He gives you all the information of his playlist. Your task is to find the position of \"Uncle Johny\" in  the sorted playlist.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. \nThe first line of each test case contains one integer N denoting the number of songs in Vlad's playlist.

The answer is 3, because {1, 3, 4, 2} -> {1, 2, 3, 4}. A2 now is on the 3-rd position.\nTest case 2\nIn the second test case N equals to 5, K equals to 5, A equals to {1, 2, 3, 9, 4}. The answer is 4, because {1, 2, 3, 9, 4} -> {1, 2, 3, 4, 9}. A5 now is on the 4-th position.\nTest case 3\nIn the third test case N equals to 5, K equals to 1, A equals to {1, 2, 3, 9, 4}. The answer is 1, because {1, 2, 3, 9, 4} -> {1, 2, 3, 4, 9}.

Using these fundamental relations we can describe all other relations between relatives. For example, one can say that Chef Prime is son of daughter of sister of father of father of Chef Composite.\nYou are given R relations of form \"A is F of B\", for N people from the party. There variable F is one of the following strings: father, mother, son, daughter, brother, sister. Also you are given Q queries of Little Joe, each query has form \"X Y\". For each query output the distance between persons X and Y. Distance is equal to the minimal number of fundamental relations appearing while describing the relation between X and Y. For example distance between Chef Prime and Chef Composite is 5. \nImportant points:\n1. Here brother (or sister) relation is considered between children of same parents only. Hence cousins are not considered brother (or sister) .\n2. Given relations meet all the following conditions:\n\nEach person has an unique name, and each name appears in at least one relation (as A, or as B).\nNo name appears more than once as the first part of relation (as A).\nThere is no cyclic relations. For example, the following relations cannot appear simultaneously in some testcase \"A is F1 of B\", \"B is F2 of C\" and \"C is F3 of A\".\n\n3.

The game will be continued for N turns, in each turn the following will be done:\nChef randomly choose some number x from his gift.\nSasha randomly choose some number y form her gift.\nIf x^y > y^x then girl will kiss fellow.\nNumbers x,y will be discarded from gifts.\nNow chef is wondering what is the expected number of times he will be kissed by Sasha ?\n\n\u00a0\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of numbers in each gift. The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the numbers Sasha gave to Chef. Next line describe B1, B2, ..., BN numbers boy gave to girl in the same way. \n\u00a0\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing answer for corresponding test. Your answer will be considered as correct if it will have absolute error not more then 10^-6.\n\u00a0\n\nConstraints\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 5\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 10^5\n1 \u2264 Ai \u2264 10^9\n1 \u2264 Bi \u2264 10^9\n\u00a0\n\nExample\n\nInput\n3\n1\n3\n4\n2\n2 3\n1 4\n2\n2 4\n2 2\n\nOutput:\n1.000000\n1.500000\n0.000000\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1.

Please read NOTE if you are not familiar with XOR operation. \nXOR-sum of a list of numbers is the result of XOR-ing all of them. XOR-sum of (A[1] XOR A[2] XOR ... XOR A[N]) is defined as A[1] XOR (A[2] XOR (A[3] XOR ( ... XOR A[N]))).\nHe has an array A consisting of N integers. Index in the array are numbered from 1 to N, inclusive. Let us denote by F(L, R), the XOR-sum of all integers in the array A whose indices lie from L to R, inclusive, i.e. F(L, R) = A[L] XOR A[L+1] XOR ... XOR A[R]. Your task is to find the total sum of XOR-sums F(L, R) over all L and R such that 1 \u2264 L \u2264 R \u2264 N.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the size of A. The second line contains N space-separated integers A[1], A[2], ..., A[N].\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the total sum to the corresponding test case.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 100,000\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 100,000\n0 \u2264 A[i] \u2264 1,000,000,000 (10^9)\nThe total sum of all N over all test cases will not exceed 100,000.\n\n\nExample\nInput:\n1\n2\n1 2\n\nOutput:\n6\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1. F(1, 1) = A[1] = 1, F(2, 2) = A[2] = 2 and F(1, 2) = A[1] XOR A[2] = 1 XOR 2 = 3. Hence the answer is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.\n\n\nNOTE\n\nXOR operation is a bitwise \"Exclusive OR\" operation performed on two integers in binary representation. First, the shorter number is prepended with leading zeroes until the numbers have equal size in binary. Then the resulting number (also in binary) contains 0 in all positions where the corresponding bits coincide, and 1 on the rest of the positions.\n For example, 3 XOR 5 = 0112 XOR 1012 = 1102 = 6.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

Magician Cyael is one such magician.\nCyael has been having some issues with her last performances and today she\u2019ll have to perform for an audience of some judges, who will change her tournament ranking, possibly increasing it. As she is a great magician she managed to gather a description of the fixed judges\u2019 disposition on the room (which is represented as an N \u00d7 N square matrix), such that she knows in advance the fixed points each judge will provide. She also knows that the room is divided into several parallel corridors, such that we will denote the j-th cell on corridor i, as [i][j]. Note that some judges can award Cyael, zero points or negative points, as they are never pleased with her performance.\nThere is just one judge at each cell of the matrix, except the cells [1][1] and [N][N].\nTo complete her evaluation, she must start on the top leftmost corner of the room (cell [1][1]), and finish on the bottom right corner (cell [N][N]), moving either to the cell directly in front of her on the same corridor (that is, moving from cell [r][c] to cell [r][c+1], where c+1 \u2264 N) or to the cell in the next corridor directly in front of where she is (that is, moving from cell [r][c] to cell [r+1][c], where r+1 \u2264 N). She will keep doing this until she reaches the end point of the room, i.e. last cell [N][N] on the last corridor.

Each of the next N lines contains N space-separated integers.\nThe j-th integer S[i][j] in i-th line denotes the points awarded by the judge at cell [i][j].\nNote that the cells [1][1] and [N][N] have no judges, so S[1][1] and S[N][N] will be 0.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, if the maximum possible average points Cyael can obtain is negative, output a single line containing \"Bad Judges\" (quotes for clarity).

A lot of boys were dreaming of becoming a knight, while a lot of girls were dreaming of marrying a knight on a white horse.\n\nIn this problem we consider one of these tournaments.\n\n\nLet's us call a tournament binary, if it runs according to the scheme described below:\n\n\nExactly N knights take part in the tournament, N^K for some integer K > 0.\nEach knight has a unique skill called strength, described as an integer from the interval [1, N].\nInitially, all the knights are standing in a line, waiting for a battle. Since all their strengths are unique, each initial configuration can be described as a permutation of numbers from 1 to N.\nThere are exactly K rounds in the tournament, 2^K - i + 1 knights take part in the i'th round. The K'th round is called the final.\nThe i'th round runs in the following way: for each positive integer j \u2264 2^K - i happens a battle between a knight on the 2\u2219j'th position and a knight on the 2\u2219j+1'th position. The strongest of two continues his tournament, taking the j'th position on the next round, while the weakest of two is forced to leave.\nThe only knight, who has won K rounds, is the winner. The only knight, who has won K - 1 rounds, but lost the final, is the runner-up.\n\t\n\nAs you can see from the scheme, the winner is always the same, an initial configuration doesn't change anything. So, your task is to determine chances of each knight to appear in the final.\n\n\nFormally, for each knight you need to count the number of initial configurations, which will lead him to the final. Since the number can be extremly huge, you are asked to do all the calculations under modulo 10^9 + 9.\n\n\nInput\nThe first line contains the only integer K, denoting the number of rounds of the tournament.\n\u00a0\n\nOutput\nOutput should consist of 2^K lines. The i'th line should contain the number of initial configurations, which lead the participant with strength equals to i to the final.\n\u00a0\n\nConstraints\n1 \u2264 K < 20\n\u00a0\n\nExamples\nInput:\n1\n\nOutput:\n2\n2\n\nInput:\n2\n\nOutput:\n0\n8\n16\n24\n\u00a0\n\nExplanation\n\nIn the first example we have N\n\n(1, 2) -> (2)\n\n\n(2, 1) -> (2)\n\n\nIn the second example we have N\n\n(1, 2, 3, 4) -> (2, 4) -> (4)\n\n\n(3, 2, 4, 1) -> (3, 4) -> (4)\n\n\n(4, 1, 3, 2) -> (4, 3) -> (4)\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

The Chef is a Game Master, so his concern is how to manage the game but not how to win the game like his assistants do.\n\n\nThe game requires players to find the only ball under one of the N cups after their positions are changed in a special way. At the beginning of the game, The Chef places N cups in a row and put a ball under the C-th cup from the left (the cups are numbered from 1 to N). All players can see the initial position of the ball. Then Chef performs Q flip operations. Each flip operation is defined by two integers L and R such that 1 \u2264 L \u2264 R \u2264 N and consists in reversing the segment [L, R] of cups. Namely, Chef swaps L-th and R-th cups, (L+1)-th and (R\u22121)-th cups, and so on. After performing all the operations Chef asks his assistants to choose a cup that they think the ball is under it. Who can guess the position of the ball will win the game, and of course, the others will have to clean the kitchen.\n\n\nThe Chef doesn't want to check all the N cups at the end of the game.

After that, she immediately tells you the integer you had thought of.\nSeeing you thoroughly puzzled, she explains that she can apply the trick so fast because she is just adding the first integer written on the cards that contain the integer you had thought of, and then gives the sum as the answer. She calls a bundle interesting if when the bundle is lexicographically sorted, no two consecutive cards have any number in common. Now she challenges you to find out the minimum number of cards she will need for making an interesting bundle such that the magic trick will work every time.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.\nEach test case contains a line with a single integer N.\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a line containing a single integer denoting the minimum number of cards required.\n\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 10^5\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 10^18\n\n\nSub tasks\n\nExample\nInput:\n2\n1\n4\n\nOutput:\n1\n3\n\nExplanation\n\nIn example 1, only 1 card containing {1} will work.\nIn example 2, make 3 cards containing {1,4}, {2} and {3,4}.\n\nAssume you thought of 1, then you will select the 1^st card {1,4}, then she will correctly figure out the integer you thought being 1.\nAssume you thought of 2, then you will select the 2^nd card {2}, then she will correctly figure out the integer you thought being 2.\nAssume you thought of 3, then you will select the 3^rd card {3,4}, then she will correctly figure out the integer you thought being 3.\nAssume you thought of 4, then you will select 1^st card {1,4} and 3^rd card {3,4}, then she will calculate the sum of the first integers of the two card 1 + 3 = 4, and she will answer it.\n\nThus her trick will work well in every case. And we can check it easily that the cards are sorted in lexicographical order and two consecutive cards have no common integers.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

Po offers dragon food to master Shifu, who is a famous cook in the valley of food. In return, Shifu hands over the dragon scroll to Po, which is said to hold the ingredients of the secret recipe. To open the dragon scroll, one has to solve the following puzzle. \n1. Consider a N-bit integer A. We call an integer A' as shuffle-A, if A' can be obtained by shuffling the bits of A in its binary representation. For eg. if N = 5 and A = 6 = (00110)2,  A' can be any 5-bit integer having exactly two 1s in it i.e., any of (00011)2, (00101)2, (00110)2, (01010)2, ...., (11000)2.\n2. Given two N-bit integers A and B, find the maximum possible value of (A' xor B') where A' is a shuffle-A, B' is a shuffle-B and xor is the bit-wise xor operator.\nGiven N, A and B, please help Po in opening the dragon scroll.\nNotes\n1. xor operator takes two bit strings of equal length and performs the logical XOR operation on each pair of corresponding bits. The result in each position is 1 if only the first bit is 1 OR only the second bit is 1, but will be 0 if both are 1 or both are 0. For eg: 5 (0101) xor 3(0011) = 6(0110). In most languages it is represented using ^ symbol. 5 ^ 3 = 6.\n2. If the integer actually needs less than N bits to represent in binary, append sufficient number of leading 0 bits. For eg. as shown in the problem statement for N = 5, A = 6 = (00110)2\n\nInput\nFirst line contains an integer T ( number of test cases, around 100 ). T cases follow, each having N A B in a single line, separated by a space.

After shuffling, xor can be maximum for (110)2 ^ (001)2 = (111)2 = 7\nCase 2: Maximum Possible result can be for (00000)2 ^ (10000)2 = (10000)2 = 16\nCase 3: Maximum Possible result can be for (0011)2 ^ (1101)2 = (1110)2 = 14\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

T test cases follow. Each test case stats with a line containing two space separated strings A and B, denoting the names of the parents.

Following this are N lines, the i'th line containing Ci, the proposed name for the i'th child.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case output a single line containing \"YES\" if the names are permissible by Archer's plan, otherwise print \"NO\".

Since Y in itself is a permutation of X, and as every string is a substring of itself, Y is a substring of X and also a permutation of X.

You should choose a starting point and make a route visiting every point exactly once, i.e. if we write down numbers of points in order you visit them we should obtain a permutation.

The boy likes to compose his disks in stacks, but there's one very important rule: the disks in a single stack must be ordered by their radiuses in a strictly increasing order such that the top-most disk will have the smallest radius.\n\n\nFor example, a stack of disks with radii (5, 2, 1) is valid, while a stack of disks with radii (3, 4, 1) is not.\n\n\nLittle Mike has recently come up with the following algorithm after the order of disks are given:\n\n\nFirst, Mike initiates an empty set of disk stacks.\nThen, Mike processes the disks in the chosen order using the following pattern:\n\nIf there is at least one stack such that Mike can put the current disk on the top of the stack without making it invalid, then he chooses the stack with the smallest top disk radius strictly greater than the radius of the current disk, and puts the current disk on top of that stack.\nOtherwise, Mike makes a new stack containing only the current disk.\n\t\n\n\nFor example, let's assume that the order of the disk radii is (3, 4, 5, 1, 1, 2). Here's how the set of the top stack disks will appear during the algorithm's run:\n\n\nIn the beginning of the algorithm, the set of disk stacks is empty. After processing the first disk, the set of top stack disks is {3}.\nWe cannot put the second disk on the only stack that we have after processing the first disk, so we make a new stack. After processing the second disk, the set of top stack disks is {3, 4}.\nWe cannot put the third disk on any of the available stacks, so we make a new stack. After processing the third disk, the set of top stack disks is {3, 4, 5}.\nThe fourth disk has radius 1, so it can be easily put on any of the available stacks. According to the algorithm, we choose the stack with the top disk radius equal to 3. After processing the fourth disk, the set of top stack disks is {1, 4, 5}.\nThe fifth disk has radius 1, so there are two stacks we can put it on. According to the algorithm, we choose the stack with the top disk radius equal to 4. After processing the fifth disk, the set of top stack disks is {1, 1, 5}.\nThe sixth disk has radius 2, so there is only one stack we can put it on. The final set of top stack disks is {1, 1, 2}.\n\n\nMike is really excited about his new algorithm, but he has so many disks that it seems impossible to simulate the algorithm manually.\n\n\nYou are given an array A of N integers denoting the radii of Mike's disks. The disks are already ordered by Mike. Your task is to find the set of the stack top disk radii after the algorithm is done.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.

From now on, he decided to paint 1D pictures only.\nChef's canvas is N millimeters long and is initially all white. For simplicity, colors will be represented by an integer between 0 and 10^5. 0 indicates white. The picture he is envisioning is also N millimeters long and the i^th millimeter consists purely of the color Ci. Unfortunately, his brush isn't fine enough to paint every millimeter one by one. The brush is 3 millimeters wide and so it can only paint three millimeters at a time with the same color. Painting over the same place completely replaces the color by the new one. Also, Chef has lots of bottles of paints of each color, so he will never run out of paint of any color.\nChef also doesn't want to ruin the edges of the canvas, so he doesn't want to paint any part beyond the painting. This means, for example, Chef cannot paint just the first millimeter of the canvas, or just the last two millimeters, etc.\nHelp Chef by telling him whether he can finish the painting or not with these restrictions.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer N. The second line contains N space-separated integers C1, C2, ..., CN denoting the colors of Chef's painting.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing either \u201cYes\u201d or \u201cNo\u201d (without quotes), denoting whether Chef can finish the painting or not.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 10^5\n3 \u2264 N \u2264 10^5\nThe sum of the Ns over all the test cases in a single test file is \u2264 5\u00d710^5\n1 \u2264 Ci \u2264 10^5\n\n\nExample\nInput:\r\n3\r\n4\r\n1 5 5 5\r\n4\r\n1 1 1 5\r\n3\r\n5 5 2\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\nYes\r\nYes\r\nNo\r\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1. Chef's canvas initially contains the colors [0,0,0,0]. Chef can finish the painting by first painting the first three millimeters with color 1, so the colors become [1,1,1,0], and then the last three millimeters with color 5 so that it becomes [1,5,5,5].\nExample case 2. Chef's canvas initially contains the colors [0,0,0,0]. Chef can finish the painting by first painting the last three millimeters by color 5 so the colors become [0,5,5,5], and then the first three millimeters by color 1 so it becomes [1,1,1,5].\nExample case 3. In this test case, Chef can only paint the painting as a whole, so all parts must have the same color, and the task is impossible.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

The types of apples are also numbered by positive integers, and the type of apple i is Ti.\nChef has recently brought two trained dogs. Both of the dogs are too intelligent to know the smell of each type of apple. If Chef gives a dog an integer x, and releases it at one end of the row of apples, then the dog smells each apple one by one. Once the dog find an apple of type x, the dog picks the apple and back to Chef's room immidiately. If there is no apple of type x, then the dog will back without any apples.\nNow Chef wants to eat two apples as soon as possible. Here the apples must have distinct types, and the sum of the types must be equal to K. Chef can release the dogs from either of the ends, namely, he can leave (both at left end) or (both at right end) or (one at left end and one at right end) and he can release them at the same time. The dogs take one second to smell each apple. However the dogs can run rapidly, so the time for moving can be ignored.

Thus Chef needs to wait 2 seconds. In any other way, Chef can't get the desired apples in less than 2 seconds.\nIn the second example, Chef cannot get two apples such that the sum of their types is 5 so the answer is \"-1\".\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

He also gives the formula for calculating the number of different objects with rang N as following:\nthe number of different objects with rang N = F(N) = A0 + A1 * N + A2 * N^2 + A3 * N^3.\nNow Chef wants to know how many different multisets of these objects exist such that sum of rangs of the objects in the multiset equals to S. You are given the coefficients in F(N) and the target sum S. Please, find the number of different multisets modulo 1,000,000,007.\nYou should consider a multiset as an unordered sequence of integers. Two multisets are different if and only if there at least exists one element which occurs X times in the first multiset but Y times in the second one, where (X \u2260 Y).\n\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. \nThe first line of each test case contains four integers A0, A1, A2, A3. The second line contains an integer S.\n\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing a single integer - the answer to the test case modulo 1,000,000,007.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 500\n1 \u2264 S \u2264 100\n0 \u2264 Ai \u2264 1000\nSum of all S for all test cases is not greater than 500.

So for each rang there is a single object of the rang. To get multiset with sum of rangs equal to 3, you can pick: three objects of rang 1, or one object of rang 1 and one of rang 2, or only one object of rang 3. \nExample case 3. \nIn the third example function looks as follows F(N) = N. So, you have one distinct object of rang 1, two distinct objects of rang 2, three distinct objects of rang 3 and so on. To get\nmultiset with sum of rangs equal to 2, you can pick: two objects of rang 1, one of objects of rang 2 (two ways).\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

These transceivers form the areas called cells (this term gave the name to the cellular phone) and every phone connects to the BTS with the strongest signal (in a little simplified view). Of course, BTSes need some attention and technicians need to check their function periodically.\n\nThe technicians faced a very interesting problem recently. Given a set of BTSes to visit, they needed to find the shortest path to visit all of the given points and return back to the central company building. Programmers have spent several months studying this problem but with no results. They were unable to find the solution fast enough. After a long time, one of the programmers found this problem in a conference article. Unfortunately, he found that the problem is so called \"Traveling Salesman Problem\" and it is very hard to solve. If we have N BTSes to be visited, we can visit them in any order, giving us N! possibilities to examine. The function expressing that number is called factorial and can be computed as a product\n\n1.2.3.4....N. The number is very high even for a relatively small N.\nThe programmers understood they had no chance to solve the problem. But because they have already received the research grant from the government, they needed to continue with their studies and produce at least some results. So they started to study behavior of the factorial function.\nFor example, they defined the function Z. For any positive integer N, Z(N) is the number of zeros at the end of the decimal form of number N!. They noticed that this function never decreases. If we have two numbers N1<N2, then  Z(N1) <= Z(N2). It is because we can never \"lose\" any\ntrailing zero by multiplying by any positive number. We can only get new and new zeros. The function Z is very interesting, so we need a computer program that can determine its value efficiently.\n\nInput\nThere is a single positive integer T on the first line of input (equal to about 100000). It stands for the number of numbers to follow. Then there are T lines, each containing exactly one positive integer number N, 1 <= N <= 1000000000.\n\nOutput\nFor every number N, output a single line containing the single non-negative integer Z(N).\n\nExample\nSample Input:\n\n6\n3\n60\n100\n1024\n23456\n8735373\n\nSample Output:\n\n0\n14\n24\n253\n5861\n2183837\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

But unfortunately, he got injured during a game a few months back and has been out of play ever since.\nHe's got proper treatment and is eager to go out and play for his team again. Before doing that, he has to prove to his fitness to the coach and manager of the team. Rayne has been playing practice matches for the past few days. He's played N practice matches in all.\nHe wants to convince the coach and the manager that he's improved over time and that his injury no longer affects his game. To increase his chances of getting back into the team, he's decided to show them stats of any 2 of his practice games. The coach and manager will look into the goals scored in both the games and see how much he's improved. If the number of goals scored in the 2nd game(the game which took place later) is greater than that in 1st, then he has a chance of getting in. Tell Rayne what is the maximum improvement in terms of goal difference that he can show to maximize his chances of getting into the team. If he hasn't improved over time, he's not fit to play. Scoring equal number of goals in 2 matches will not be considered an improvement. Also, he will be declared unfit if he doesn't have enough matches to show an improvement.\n\nInput:\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T, the number of test cases.\nEach test case begins with a single integer N, the number of practice matches Rayne has played.\nThe next line contains N integers. The ith integer, gi, on this line represents the number of goals Rayne scored in his ith practice match. The matches are given in chronological order i.e. j > i means match number j took place after match number i.\n\n\nOutput:\nFor each test case output a single line containing the maximum goal difference that Rayne can show to his coach and manager. If he's not fit yet, print \"UNFIT\".\n\n\nConstraints:\n1<=T<=10\n1<=N<=100000\n0<=gi<=1000000 (Well, Rayne's a legend!

Thus he gets a difference of 7-3=4 goals. Any other pair would give him a lower improvement.\nIn the second test case, Rayne has not been improving in any match. Thus he's declared UNFIT.\nNote: Large input data. Use faster I/O methods. Prefer scanf,printf over cin/cout.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

The number of inversions is equal to the number of pairs of integers (i; j) such that 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 N and A[i] > A[j], and the number of local inversions is the number of integers i such that 1 \u2264 i < N and A[i] > A[i+1].\n\n\nThe Little Elephant has several such permutations.

Here N = 1, so we have no pairs (i; j) with 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 N. So the number of inversions is equal to zero. The number of local inversion is also equal to zero. Hence this permutation is good.\n\n\nCase 2. Here N = 2, and we have one pair (i; j) with 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 N, the pair (1; 2). Since A[1] = 2 and A[2] = 1 then A[1] > A[2] and the number of inversions is equal to 1. The number of local inversion is also equal to 1 since we have one value of i for which 1 \u2264 i < N (the value i = 1) and A[i] > A[i+1] for this value of i since A[1] > A[2]. Hence this permutation is also good.\n\n\nCase 3. Here N = 3, and we have three pairs (i; j) with 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 N. We have A[1] = 3, A[2] = 2, A[3] = 1. Hence A[1] > A[2], A[1] > A[3] and A[2] > A[3]. So the number of inversions is equal to 3. To count the number of local inversion we should examine inequalities A[1] > A[2] and A[2] > A[3]. They both are satisfied in our case, so we have 2 local inversions. Since 2 \u2260 3 this permutations is not good.\n\n\nCase 4. Here we have only one inversion and it comes from the pair (2; 3) since A[2] = 3 > 2 = A[3]. This pair gives also the only local inversion in this permutation. Hence the number of inversions equals to the number of local inversions and equals to one. So this permutation is good.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

They want to decide it in a fair way. So they agree to play a game to make a decision. Their favourite childhood game!\nThe game consists of C boards. Each board i is a grid of dimension ni x mi.\n\nRules of the game:\n- A coin is placed at (1,1) on every board initially.\n- Each one takes a turn alternatively.\n- In one turn, a player can choose any one board and move a coin from a cell (i,j) to one of the following cells:\n\t(i+1,j) OR (i+2,j) OR (i,j+1) OR (i,j+2) OR (i+1,j+1) OR (i+2,j+2).\n- A coin cannot be moved out of the board at any point during the game.\n- A coin cannot be moved once it reaches the cell (n,m) where n and m are the dimensions of the board of that coin.\n- A player MUST make one valid move.\n- The player who makes the last move gets to watch TV.\n\nBoth of them are passionate about their interests and want to watch their respective shows.

For this, he made a strange stage and drew two horizontal parallel lines on the stage. There are N unmarried male chefs in the reunion and he gave each male chef i an unique number Mi. Then all male chefs will stand in the first line drawn by Chef. But they will stand in increasing order of their number. That means chef with the lowest number will stand at the leftmost position of the line, then right to him would be the chef with the second lowest number and so on. Similarly, there are N female chefs in the reunion and Chef also gave each female chef j an unique number Fj (sequences Fj and Mi can have equal numbers). Then all female chefs will stand in the other line following the same rule(will stand in increasing order of the numbers) as the male chef. \nNow chef will choose all the marriage pairs himself. He will select a female chef and a male chef (both of them have not selected before) and will draw a straight line between them. He calls this line a marriage line.

        "prompt": "### Prompt\nSuraj, the Chief Prankster is back in action now and this time he has stolen the valentine's day gift given by Ashi (the love of Chef) to the Chef and ran away with it to Byteland.\nByteland is a not a regular place like Chef's town. The safest way from Chef's town to Byteland is through the path of tasty dishes. The path is named so because there are magical tasty dishes which appear to the traveler that no one can resist eating. Also, Suraj has added a strong sleep potion to each of the dish on this path to stop anyone from following him.\nKnowing the devilish nature of Suraj, Ashi is concerned about the Chef and has asked all of Chef's town people to help. The distance from Chef's town to Byteland through the the path of tasty dishes is X units. They have the location where the magic dishes are and how many people are required to eat it completely. Anyone who eats a dish would go to a long sleep and won't be able to continue. They have the information about the tribal clans that live along the the path of tasty dishes who can be of real help in this journey. \nThe journey Chef and his friends can be described as follows: There is a total of B dishes on the path of tasty dishes. Each dish is located at some distance from Chef's town denoted by xi for the i^th dish ( xi-1 <  xi). To minimize the number of friends Chef has to leave behind, all of them have decided that exactly yi of them will eat the i^th dish, which is the required number of people needed to finish it completely. Also, there are a total of C tribal chef clans, each with their own population and location on the path that Chef and his friends will meet on their way to Byteland. They know that for some clan (say i), they are located at a distance of pi ( pi-1 <  pi) from Chef's town with a population of ri. And if a group of at least qi men approaches them, they would be able to convince them to join their forces against Suraj.\nGiven the information about all this, help the Chef to find out the minimum size of the group (including him and his friends) he should start with to reach Byteland and get back Ashi's gift from Suraj.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each test case contains three lines which are as follows:\nFirst line of each test case contains X, the distance of Byteland from Chef's town.\nNext line contains an integer B, the number of dishes on the path of tasty dishes. Then follows B pairs of space separated integers of the form xi yi, where xi yi are as defined above for the i^th dish.\nNext line contains an integer C, followed C space separated triplets of integers pi qi ri as defined above.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print the minimum size of the group  (including Chef) that is needed to reach Byteland.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 10\n1 \u2264 X \u2264 10^9\n1 \u2264 B \u2264 10000\n Constraints on C\n\nSubproblem 1 (25 points):  C = 0\nSubproblem 2 (75 points): 1 \u2264 C \u2264 10000\n\n\n1 \u2264 xi < X, xi < xi+1\n1 \u2264 pi < X, pi < pi+1\n1 \u2264 yi \u2264 10^14\n1 \u2264 qi \u2264 10^14\n1 \u2264 ri \u2264 10^14\nAll the positions, of the tasty dishes and tribal clans are distinct.\n\n\nExample\nInput:\n3\n10\n2 1 3 8 1\n0\n10\n2 1 3 8 5\n0\n10\n2 2 3 8 5\n3 1 2 1 4 3 2 9 1 1 \n\nOutput:\n5\n9\n6\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1. In the first case, there are no tribal clans, and two dishes, one which needs to be eaten by 3 chefs on their way and one to be eaten by 1 chef. Hence, we have to start with atleast 5 people in total to pass the path of tasty dishes.\nExample case 2. Similar as Example Case 1.\nExample case 3. In this case, if we start with 5 Chefs. At point 1, we have more than or equal to 2 chefs, hence the tribal clan of size 1 adds to the Chef's party and now they have size of 6. At position 2, three of them would be left behind eating a dish, leaving 3 of them to go ahead. At position 4, since the size is exactly 3, the tribal clan joins the chef's party making it of size 5. At position 8, all 5 of them will stop to eat the dish and none would go ahead. Similarly, if we start with 6, one of them would be able to pass position 8 and reach position 9, where it will also add one of the tribal clans to its party and reach Byteland.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

There is a list of n jobs to do before the kitchen can be closed for the night. These jobs are indexed from 1 to n.\n\n\nMost of the cooks have already left and only the Chef and his assistant are left to clean up. Thankfully, some of the cooks took care of some of the jobs before they left so only a subset of the n jobs remain. The Chef and his assistant divide up the remaining jobs in the following manner. The Chef takes the unfinished job with least index, the assistant takes the unfinished job with the second least index, the Chef takes the unfinished job with the third least index, etc. That is, if the unfinished jobs were listed in increasing order of their index then the Chef would take every other one starting with the first job in the list and the assistant would take every other one starting with the second job on in the list.\n\n\nThe cooks logged which jobs they finished before they left.

        "prompt": "### Prompt\nBhallaladeva was an evil king who ruled the kingdom of Maahishmati. He wanted to erect a 100ft golden statue of himself and he looted gold from several places for this. He even looted his own people, by using the following unfair strategy:\nThere are N houses in Maahishmati, and the i^th house has Ai gold plates. Each gold plate costs exactly 1 Nimbda, which is the unit of currency in the kingdom of Maahishmati. Bhallaladeva would choose an integer K, and loots all the houses in several steps. In each step:\n\nHe would choose a house i which hasn't been looted yet, pay the owner exactly Ai Nimbdas, and take away all the gold plates in that house (Hence, he also ends up looting this house).\nHe would now choose atmost K houses which haven't been looted yet and take away all the gold plates from these houses without paying a single Nimbda (Yes, he takes all of them for free).\n\n\nHe repeats the above steps until all the N houses have been looted. Your task is to devise a strategy for Bhallaladeva to loot the houses in some order, so that the number of nimbdas he has to pay is minimium. You'll also be given multiple values of K (Q of them to be precise), and you need to find the minimum number of nimbdas for each of these values.\n\nInput\nThe first line of input consists of a single integer N denoting the number of houses in Maahishmati. The second line of input consists of N space separated integers denoting A1, A2, ..., AN, where Ai denotes the number of gold plates in the i^th house. The third line of input consists of a single integer Q denoting the number of values of K to follow. Each of the following Q lines consist of a single integer, where the value on the i^th line denotes the value of K for the i^th query.\n\n\nOutput\nOutput exactly Q integers on separate lines, where the output on the i^th line denotes the answer for the i^th value of K.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 10^5\n1 \u2264 Q \u2264 10^5\n0 \u2264 K \u2264 N-1\n1 \u2264 Ai \u2264 10^4\n\n\nExample\nInput:\n4\n3 2 1 4\n2\n0\n2\n\nOutput:\n10\n3\n\nExplanation\nFor the first query, K = 0. Hence, Bhallaladeva cannot take gold plates from any of the houses for free. It will cost him 3 + 2 + 1 + 4 = 10 nimbdas.\nFor the second query, K = 2. In the first step Bhallaladeva can pay 2 nimbdas for gold plates in house number 2, and take the gold in houses 1 and 4 for free (Note that house 1 has 3 gold plates and house 4 has 4 gold plates). Now, he has looted houses 1, 2 & 4. Now in the second step, he loots house 3, by paying 1 nimbda. Hence, the total cost = 1 + 2 = 3. Note that there might be multiple ways to achieve the minimum cost, and we have explained only one of them.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

        "prompt": "### Prompt\nRecently Chef has decided to make some changes in our beloved Codechef. As you know, each problem at Codechef has its memory and time limits. To make problems even more challenging, he decided to measure allocated memory in a different way. Now judge program will be calculating not the maximum memory usage during the execution of all test files, but all the memory ever allocated by the solution program. But as Chef is not that good in algorithms, so he asks you to write a program that will calculate total memory usage of a solution.\nSo, you are given N numbers M1, , ,MN representing the measurements of consumed memory (in MBs) for N test files. In other terms, it means that on i-th test file, program took Mi MBs of memory. Initially, there is no memory allocated for your program. Before running your program on each test file, if the currently allocated memory is more than memory needed for the current test file, then there will be a deallocation of the memory to fit the current program. Also, if there is less than needed memory available, then allocation of memory will happen so as to fit the current program. e.g. Let us say that our program took 10 MBs on current test file. So, assuming if there was 12 MBs memory allocated before running the program on current test file, then there will happen a deallocation of 2 MBs. Assuming if there was 8 MBs memory allocated before running the program on current test file, then there will happen a allocation of 2 MBs.\n\n\nCalculate the total memory allocated for running the solution program on all the N test files. Please see third sample for more clarity.\n\nInput\nFirst line of input contains a single integer T denoting the  number of test cases. First line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the number of measurements. Second line of each test case contains N space separated integers, where i^th integer denotes the consumption of memory for i^th i-th test file.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print total memory allocated for running the solution program.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 10^5\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 10^5\n1 \u2264 Mi \u2264 10^9\n sum of N over all test cases does not exceed 10^5\n\n\nExample\nInput:\n3\n2\n1 1\n5\n1 2 3 4 5\n3\n1 3 2\n\nOutput:\n1\n5\n3\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1. Initially, there was no memory allocated. For running first test file, there was a memory allocation of 1 MBs. There was no allocation/ deallocation for running your program on second test file. \nExample case 2. On running on each test file, there was a further allocation of 1 MBs from previous one. So, there are total 5 MBs of memory allocated while running the program.\nExample case 3. Initially, there was no memory allocated. For running first test file, there was a memory allocation of 1 MBs. For running second test file, there was a further memory allocation of 2 MBs to have 3 MBs of memory needed, then in the last file, there was a deallocation of 1 MB of memory so as to get 2 MBs of memory needed for running the program. So, overall, there was 1 + 2 = 3 MBs of memory ever allocated in the program. Note that we are only counting allocated memory, not allocated + unallocated.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

If there is more than one solution, you can print any one of them.\nif such a route doesn't exist, output just -2 on the separate line.\n\n\nConstraints\nExample\nInput:\n2\n2 5\n-1 -1\n4 3\n1 -1 1 -1\n\nOutput:\n-1 -1\n1 -1\n1 1\n-1 1\n-2\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1. It is easy to see that the square of the euclidean distance between any two adjacent rooms in the route will not exceed D = 5.\nExample case 2. It is clearly impossible to accomplish the task.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",
