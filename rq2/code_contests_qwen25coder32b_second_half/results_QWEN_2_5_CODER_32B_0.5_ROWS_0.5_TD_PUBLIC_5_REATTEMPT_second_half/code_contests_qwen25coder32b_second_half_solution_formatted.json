A number is a k-prime if it has exactly k distinct prime factors. The game is quite simple. Alice will give three numbers A, B & K to Bob. Bob needs to tell Alice the number of K-prime numbers between A & B (both inclusive). If Bob gives the correct answer, he gets a point. If not, Alice gets a point.

Mr.Ping makes the best noodle soup and his son Po is eagerly waiting for the user reviews in his father's blog. Users can vote with a (+) or a (-) and accordingly +1 or -1 is added to the total score respectively. Note that if a user votes multiple times, only his/her latest vote is counted towards the total score.\nPo opens the blog to see initial score of 0. To see the updated score without refreshing the page, he has to keep voting himself. After each of Po's clicks on (+) or (-), he can see the current total score, of course that considers Po's vote too. He is wondering how many users other than him could have possibly voted. Given the sequence of clicks made by Po and the total score displayed just after each of his clicks, can you tell him the minimum number of users that could have possibly voted at least once, other than Po.\n\n\nInput\nThere are multiple test cases ( at most 21 ). Each case starts with an integer N ( 1 <= N <= 1000 ), the number of Po's clicks. Sequence of N clicks follows, one on each line of the form \"vote score\" (without quotes, separated by a space), where vote is either a 'P' or a 'M', representing Plus(+) and Minus(-) respectively, the one clicked by Po and score is the score displayed after Po's click ( -1,000,000,000 <= score <= 1,000,000,000 ). The last case has N = 0 and should not be processed. Each case is followed by an empty line.\n\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output the minimum number of users that could have possibly voted at least once.\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n2\nP 1\nP 2\n\n2\nP 2\nM -2\n\n0\n\nOutput:\n1\n1\n\n\nExplanation:\nCase 1 :\nP 1 , Po voted (+) and score = 1 is possibly Po's vote itself.\nP 2 , Po again voted (+), but as only latest vote of a user is counted, Po contributed only +1 to the score, so possibly one more user voted with a (+). Remember that we have to find the number of users other than Po, so answer is 1\n\nCase 2 :\nP 2 , Po voted (+) and score = 2, possibly another user A also voted (+)\nM -2 , Po voted (-) and score = -2. Possibly the same user A also voted (-)\nSo there can possibly be just one other user A\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

Chef knows all the questions that can be asked, and for each of them he knows the answer candidate he will choose (some of them can be incorrect). For each question, we'll tell you Chef's answer to it.\nThe game goes on as follows. First, all the questions are shuffled randomly. Then, a contestant is asked these questions one-by-one in the new shuffled order. If the contestant answers any question incorrectly, the game is over. Total winnings of the contestant are calculated as follows. Let X denote the number of questions answered correctly by the contestant. Depending on this value, the winnings are determined: W0 dollars is the amount won for X = 0, W1 dollars is for X = 1, and so on till X = N. Note that the game was invented by a twisted mind, and so a case where Wi \u2265 Wi + 1 for some 0 \u2264 i \u2264 N \u2212 1 is possible.\nChef is interested in finding the maximum possible winnings that he can amass.\n\nInput\nThe first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.

If questions will be placed in order: 2^nd (Chef's answer is B, which is correct), 3^rd (Chef's answer is C, and it is correct as well), 4^th (Chef's answer is D, and he is right), 5^th (Chef's answer is A but correct answer is E and the game is over), 1^st, Chef will correctly answer 3 questions, and therefore win 30 dollars.\nExample case 2. Chef's answers for all questions are incorrect, so his winnings are W0 dollars.\nExample case 3. Since all Wi are equal to 100 dollars, Chef will win this sum in any possible case.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

For example, 22/7 differs in the third digit after the decimal point. So, these values are definitely should not be used for serious calculations.\nHowever, Chef doesn't know anything about 103993/33102. This fraction is quite inconvenient to calculate on paper. Chef is curious how precise this value is. So he asks you to help him and to calculate the first K digits after the decimal point of such an approximation of \u03c0.

Chef Ciel would like to run 2 restaurants in Wolf town, where the first restaurant will be supplied by the market S and the second one will be supplied by the market T. The markets run delivery service without charge within some distance, DS and DT respectively. Near these markets there are many rival restaurants. So Ciel decides to build one of her restaurants exactly at the distance DS from the market S, and build the other restaurant exactly at the distance DT from the market T.\nChef Ciel would like to build her restaurants as close as possible to each other for convenient communication. Your task is to calculate the minimum distance that could be achieved between her restaurants.\nNote. Wolf town can be considered as an infinite 2D Cartesian plane. The markets and Ciel's restaurants should be considered as points on a plane. The distance between the two points A and B, whose coordinates are (Ax, Ay) and (Bx, By) respectively, is defined by Dist(A, B) = ((Ax \u2212 Bx)^2 + (Ay \u2212 By)^2)^1/2.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains three space-separated integers DS, DT and D.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the minimum possible distance between Ciel's restaurants that could be achieved. The output must have an absolute or relative error at most 0.000001 (10^\u22126). Please, note that your output should not have more than 1000 digits after the decimal point, otherwise you may (or may not) get wrong answer or runtime error (SIGXFSZ).\nNote also that the answer could be 0, which means that two Ciel's restaurants should be located at the same building.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 2013\n1 \u2264 DS, DT, D \u2264 2013\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n4\n15 15 50\n15 15 18\n43 88 200\n2013 2013 2013\n\nOutput:\n20.000\n0.0\n69.00000\n0\n\nExplanation \nExample case 1. The distance between markets S and T is 50. Assume for simplicity that S has coordinates (0, 0) and T has coordinates (50, 0). Then Ciel could build her first restaurant RS at the point (15, 0) and the second restaurant RT at the point (35, 0). This will ensure that the distance between S and RS is DS = 15 and the distance between T and RT is DT = 15. The distance between restaurants appear to be 20 in this scenario. One can prove that this is the minimum possible distance.\nExample case 2. Here Ciel can locate both her restaurants at the same place. Indeed, if S = (0, 0) and T = (18, 0) then Ciel could locate both her restaurants at the point R = (9, 12). To check this note that Dist(R, S) = ((9 \u2212 0)^2 + (12 \u2212 0)^2)^1/2 = (81 + 144)^1/2 = 225^1/2 = 15. Similarly it can be verified that Dist(R, T) = 15.\nExample case 3. It is similar to the example case 1. If S = (0, 0) and T = (200, 0) then the best way is to locate Ciel's restaurants at the points RS = (43, 0) and RT = (112, 0). You can easily check by yourself that Dist(S, RS) = 43, Dist(T, RT) = 88 and Dist(RS, RT) = 69.\nJust to reiterate, your output can have any number of digits after the decimal point unless it is too long (more than 1000 digits after decimal point). However your output must have an absolute or relative error at most 10^\u22126.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

Given a string, you need to tell if it is a lapindrome.\n\nInput:\nFirst line of input contains a single integer T, the number of test cases.\nEach test is a single line containing a string S composed of only lowercase English alphabet.\n\nOutput:\nFor each test case, output on a separate line: \"YES\" if the string is a lapindrome and \"NO\" if it is not.\n\nConstraints:\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 100\n2 \u2264 |S| \u2264 1000, where |S| denotes the length of S\n\n\nExample:\nInput:\n\n6\ngaga\nabcde\nrotor\nxyzxy\nabbaab\nababc\n\n\nOutput:\n\nYES\nNO\nYES\nYES\nNO\nNO\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

The schedule for the trains has recently been changed and he wants to know how long it will take to travel from the station nearest to his house and the station nearest to his restaurant.\n\n\nThe Chef doesn't want to change the route he took before, so he simply has to find out how long it will take to reach his restaurant along his usual route. This route is given by a sequence of stations s0, s1, ..., sn where s0 is the station where the Chef enters the metro and sn is the station where the Chef exits the metro.\n\n\nTrains are scheduled to run between every two consecutive stations si-1 and si. Such a schedule is specified by three integers xi, li, and fi. This means that the first train on this line starts operating at time xi. The time it takes this train to travel from si-1 and si is exactly li units. Finally, a train departs from station si-1 every fi minutes following the previous train. That is, a train departs at time xi, xi+fi, xi+2fi, and so on.\n\n\n\nThe Chef is very experienced at navigating the metro so the time it takes him to transfer between trains at a given station  is essentially zero. Thus, if the Chef arrives at a station, say si, the moment that the train from si to si+1 is scheduled to depart, he skillfully hops on this next train. However, if the Chef arrives when no train to si+1 is scheduled to depart, he must wait until the scheduled departure time.\n\n\nHelp the Chef figure out how long it will take him to travel from station s0 to station sn. You may assume that the Chef is already at station s0 at time 0.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line consists of a single integer denoting the number of test cases (at most 50). Each test case begins with a line containing a single integer n between 1 and 1000 indicating the number of lines the Chef must traverse (so there are n+1 stations s0, s1, ..., sn).

An ingredient is represented by a letter 'a'-'z'. The i-th letter in a recipe denotes the i-th ingredient. An ingredient can be used multiple times in a recipe.\nThe technique is as follows. Compare two recipes by comparing their respective lists. If the sets of ingredients used in both recipes are equal and each ingredient is used the same number of times in both of them (processing order does not matter), they are declared as granama recipes. (\"granama\" is the Chef-ian word for \"similar\".)\nChef took two recipes he invented yesterday. He wanted to compare them using the technique. Unfortunately, Chef forgot to keep track of the number of times each ingredient has been used in a recipe. He only compared the ingredients but NOT their frequencies. More precisely, Chef considers two recipes as granama if there are no ingredients which are used in one recipe and not used in the other recipe.\nYour task is to report whether Chef has correctly classified the two recipes (as granama or not granama) although he forgot to keep track of the frequencies.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.

They are actually granama because the sets of ingredients and the number of times each ingredient has been used are equal. The Chef got it right!\nExample case 2: Chef declared them as granama recipes because both sets of ingredients are equal. But they are NOT granama since ingredient 'a' has been used twice in the first recipe but only once in the second. The Chef was incorrect!\nExample case 3: Chef declare them as not granama. They are not granama as the sets of ingredients are different. Hence, the Chef was right!\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

    "prompt": "### Prompt\nIn the world of DragonBool there are fierce warriors called Soints. Also there are even fiercer warriors called Sofloats \u2013 the mortal enemies of Soints.\n\n\nThe power of each warrior is determined by the amount of chakra he possesses which is some positive integer. Warriors with zero level of chakra are dead warriors :) When the fight between Soint with power CI and Sofloat with power CF occurs the warrior with lower power will die and the winner will lose the amount of chakra that his enemy have possessed before the fight. So three cases are possible:\n\nCI > CF. Then Sofloat will die while the new power of Soint will be CI \u2013 CF.\nCI < CF. Then Soint will die while the new power of Sofloat will be CF \u2013 CI.\nCI = CF. In this special case both warriors die.\n\n\nEach warrior (Soint or Sofloat) has his level of skills which is denoted by some positive integer. The fight between two warriors can occur only when these warriors are Soint and Sofloat of the same level. In particual, friendly fights are not allowed, i.e., a Soint cannot fight with another Soint and the same holds for Sofloats.\n\n\nLets follow the following convention to denote the warriors. A Soint of level L and power C will be denoted as (I, C, L), while Sofloat of level L and power C will be denoted as (F, C, L). Consider some examples. If A = (I, 50, 1) fights with B = (F, 20, 1), B dies and A becomes (I, 30, 1). On the other hand, (I, 50, 1) cannot fight with (F, 20, 2) as they have different levels.\n\n\nThere is a battle between Soints and Sofloats. There are N Soints and M Sofloats in all. The battle will consist of series of fights. As was mentioned above in each fight one Soint and one Sofloat of the same level take part and after the fight the warrior with lower power will die (or both will die if they have the same power). The battle proceeds as long as there exists at least one pair of warriors who can fight. The distribution of warriors by levels satisfies the following condition: for every Soint of level L there exists at least one Sofloat of the same level L and vice-versa. So if for some level L we have at least one warrior of this level then there is at least one Soint of level L and at least one Sofloat of level L.\n\n\nThere is a powerful wizard, whose name is SoChef, on the side of Soints. He can increase the amount of chakra of each Soint by any number. SoChef wants the army of Soints to win this battle. But increasing amount of chakra of any Soint by one costs him a lot of his magic power. Hence he wants to minimize the total amount of additional chakra he should give to Soints in order for them to win. Note, however, that the win here means that all Sofloats should be dead irregardless of whether any Soint is alive. Also note that the battle can proceed by different scenarios and the SoChef need to distribute additional chakra among the Soints in such a way that they will win for any possible battle scenario. Help SoChef and find the minimal amount of additional chakra he should give to Soints in order for them to win.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers N and M. Here N is the number of Soints  participating in the battle and M is the number of Sofloats  for the same. Each of the next N lines contains two space separated integers  Ci and  Li, the amount of chakra and level of i-th Soint correspondingly. The next M lines describe power and level of Sofloats participating in the battle in the same format.\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case output a single integer on a single line, the minimum amount of chakra SoChef should give to Soints in order for them to win the battle.\n\n\nConstraints\nEach integer in the input file is positive and does not exceed 100. That is\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 100\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 100\n1 \u2264 M \u2264 100\n1 \u2264 Ci \u2264 100\n1 \u2264 Li \u2264 100\nFor every Soint of level L there exists at least one Sofloat of the same level L and vice-versa.\nIt is guaranteed that each official test file will satisfy all these constraints. You DON'T need to verify them in your program.\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n2\n2 3\n10 1\n20 2\n5 2\n5 2\n18 1\n5 5\n73 87\n69 13\n36 36\n77 46\n43 93\n49 46\n74 93\n78 87\n99 13\n59 36\n\nOutput:\n8\n89\n\n\nExplanation\n\nCase 1.\nThe warriors are I1 = (I, 10, 1), I2 = (I, 20, 2), F1 = (F, 5, 2), F2 = (F, 5, 2), F3 = (F, 18, 1). Without the SoChef help the battle can proceed as follows.\n\n\nI2 fights with F1, F1 dies, I2 becomes (I, 15, 2).\nI2 fights with F2, F2 dies, I2 becomes (I, 10, 2).\nI1 fights with F3, I1 dies, F3 becomes (F, 8, 1).\n\n\nSo if SoChef will give 8 additional units of chakra to I1 the Soints will win the battle and even one Soint (I2) will left alive. Hence the answer is 8.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

Everyday Chef Juno comes up with new problems for her to solve, otherwise she gets bored and depressed. He doesn't want her to feel so, but he has run out of all problems. He consults his Chef friends, who came up with a new problem.\nThe Chef City is an N-dimensional city of dimensions L[0]*..*L[N-1] and each of the (L[0]*..*L[N-1]) cells may have 0 to V-1 restaurants. They want to know the number of ways they can open restaurants in each cell of the city such that the sum of the number of restaurants in every sub-block(see details) in Chef City is divisible by V.\nChef Juno realizes that this number could be very huge given the size of Chef City, so to make this problem a little easier for his girlfriend (and for himself, as he should himself know the solution ;)), he wants the answer modulo 1000000007. But before asking her this problem, he wants to know the answer himself. So he turns to you for help. Please help him :)\n\nDetails\nA sub-block of an N-dimensional hyperrectangle can be defined as an N-dimensional hyperrectangle of\n1*1*..L[i]..*1*1 dimensions for i ranging from 0 to N-1, where the ith dimension is L[i].\nFor example, in a 2*3*2 cuboid, we can have sub-blocks of\n2*1*1, 1*3*1 and 1*1*2 dimensions and each of the 12 cells can have\n0 to V-1 restaurants in such a way that the sum of the number of restaurants in every sub-block is divisible by V.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains two space-separated integers V and N.\nSince the input file size may go large, we ask you to generate the input using the following scheme.\nYou have two lines of 6 integers each.\nThe first line consists of the integers P[0], P[1], A0, B0, C0, M0.\nThe second line consists of the integers Q[0], Q[1], A1, B1, C1, M1.\nUsing the above, you can generate arrays P[] and Q[] as follows:\nP[i] = A0 * A0 * P[i-1] + B0 * P[i-2] + C0 modulo (M0)\nQ[i] = A1 * A1 * Q[i-1] + B1 * Q[i-2] + C1 modulo (M1)\nfor i \u2265 2 and i < N\nFrom this, the ith dimension can be calculated as follows: \nThe ith dimension, L[i] = P[i]*(M1)+Q[i]+1 for i \u2265 0 and i < N\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the answer. As was mentioned above, you should print this number modulo 1000000007.\n\nConstraints\n1 <= T <= 100000\n2 <= N <= 100\n1 <= V <= 2^63 - 1\n0<=A[0],A[1],B[0],B[1],C[0],C[1]<=100000\n0 <= P[0], P[1] < max(10^5+1, M0)\nand\n0 <= Q[0], Q[1] < max(10^5+1, M1)\n1<=M0 and M1<=2^31-1\nAll N dimensions after calculation will be between 1 and 2^63 \u2013 1.\n\nExample\nInput:\n\n3\n1 2\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n1 1 1 1 1 1\n3 2\n1 1 1 1 1 2\n2 1 1 1 1 1\n3 3\n1 1 1 1 1 2\n1 1 0 0 0 2\nOutput:\n1\n729\n387420489\n\nExplanation\nTest case 1: Since V is equal to 1, there is only way to open restaurants in the 2 dimensional city of dimensions 3*3:\n| 0 0 0 |\n| 0 0 0 |\n| 0 0 0 |\nHere the sum of the number of restaurants opened in every sub-block of dimensions 1*3 and 3*1\n is divisible by 1.\n\n\nTest case 2: Here the dimensions of the city are 4*3 and V=3.\nSo one of the ways to open restaurants in each cell of the\ncity is:\n|1 0 2|\n|2 1 0|\n|1 2 0|\n|2 0 1|\nHere the sum of the number of restaurants opened in every sub-block of dimensions 1*3 and 4*1\nis divisible by V=3.\n\n\nTest case 3: Here we are given a 3-dimensional hyperrectangle\nof dimensions 4*4*3 and V is 3.\nSo in each of the 48 cells, we can open 0 to 2 restaurants, but we have to ensure that sum of the number of restaurants in every 4*1*1 sub-block, 1*4*1 sub-block and 1*1*3 sub-block is divisible by 3.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

    "prompt": "### Prompt\nDevu is a class teacher of a class of n students. One day, in the morning prayer of the school, all the students of his class were standing in a line. You are given information of their arrangement by a string s. The string s consists of only letters 'B' and 'G', where 'B' represents a boy and 'G' represents a girl.\nDevu wants inter-gender interaction among his class should to be maximum. So he does not like seeing two or more boys/girls standing nearby (i.e. continuous) in the line. e.g. he does not like the arrangements BBG and GBB, but he likes BG, GBG etc.\nNow by seeing the initial arrangement s of students, Devu may get furious and now he wants to change this arrangement into a likable arrangement. For achieving that, he can swap positions of any two students (not necessary continuous). Let the cost of swapping people from position i with position j (i \u2260 j) be c(i, j). You are provided an integer variable type, then the cost of the the swap will be defined by c(i, j) = |j \u2212 i|^type.\nPlease help Devu in finding minimum cost of swaps needed to convert the current arrangement into a likable one.\n\nInput\nThe first line of input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases are follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer type, denoting the type of the cost function. Then the next line contains string s of length n, denoting the initial arrangement s of students.\nNote that the integer n is not given explicitly in input.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line containing the answer of the test case, that is, the minimum cost to convert the current arrangement into a likable one. If it is not possible to convert the current arrangement into a likable one, then print -1 instead of the minimum cost.\n\nConstraints and Example\nInput:\n8\n0\nBB\n0\nBG\n0\nBBGG\n1\nBGG\n1\nBGGB\n1\nBBBGG\n2\nBBGG\n2\nBGB\n\nOutput:\n-1\n0\n1\n1\n1\n3\n1\n0\n\nExplanation\nNote type of the first 3 test cases is 0. So c(i, j) = 1. Hence we just have to count minimum number of swaps needed.\nExample case 1. There is no way to make sure that both the boys does not stand nearby. So answer is -1.\nExample case 2. Arrangement is already valid. No swap is needed. So answer is 0.\nExample case 3. Swap boy at position 1 with girl at position 2. After swap the arrangement will be BGBG which is a valid arrangement. So answer is 1.\nNow type of the next 3 test cases is 1. So c(i, j) = |j \u2212 i|, that is, the absolute value of the difference between i and j.\nExample case 4. Swap boy at position 0 with girl at position 1. After swap the arrangement will be GBG which is a valid arrangement. So answer is |1 - 0| = 1.\nExample case 5. Swap boy at position 0 with girl at position 1. After swap the arrangement will be GBGB which is a valid arrangement. So answer is |1 - 0| = 1.\nExample case 6. Swap boy at position 1 with girl at position 4. After swap the arrangement will be BGBGB which is a valid arrangement. So answer is |4 - 1| = 3.\nThen type of the last 2 test cases is 2. So c(i, j) = (j \u2212 i)^2\nExample case 7. Swap boy at position 1 with girl at position 2. After swap the arrangement will be BGBG which is a valid arrangement. So answer is (2 - 1)^2 = 1.\nExample case 8. Arrangement is already valid. No swap is needed. So answer is 0.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

In one of the rooms, the evil wazir has imprisoned\nthe princess. The noble prince is on his way to rescue the\nprincess.\nThe prince starts in the room at the top left corner of the grid,\nwhich is labelled (1,1).  Each room contains some guards.  It takes a\ncertain amount of time before the prince can kill all the guards in\nthe room he is in.  The time taken to kill the guards varies from room\nto room.  Once he has killed all the guards in a room, he can move on\nto any one of its neighbours by going left, right, up or down,\nprovided, of course, that there is a neighbouring room in the\ncorresponding direction.\nThe wazir, knowing that the prince is on his way, has set a time\nbomb that will kill the princess after T seconds.  You will\nbe given the position of the princess, the time left for the bomb to\ngo off and the time it takes for the prince to kill the guards in each\nof the rooms in the dungeon.  Your task is to determine if it is\npossible for the prince to reach the princess and save her by defusing\nthe bomb before the T seconds expire.\n For example, suppose the dungeon is described by the following\ngrid of numbers.\n2 3 2\n2 5 1\n5 3 1\n3 1 1\n\nThe number at position (i,j) indicates the time taken for\nthe prince to overpower the guards in room (i,j).

However, if\nT = 15, the prince can reach the princess with 4 seconds to\nspare, as follows.  Starting from (1,1), he moves right to (1,2) and\nthen (1,3), comes down all the way to (4,3) and then moves (4,2).  This\ntakes 11 seconds (note that he must also overpower the guard in the\nroom where the princess is incarcerated).

Any unsigned voucher will not allowed to take out of the park.\nAfter the visit is done, the ticket counter takes back your ticket.\nIf it is your second time visit, then the counter will take back your voucher. No new voucher will be provided to you as you have already availed the offer.\nYou can avail the offer as many times as you wish in a day, i.e. offer is applicable for each visit with a paid ticket.\n\n\nObviously, this procedure has a flaw. The counter doesn't ask you to sign your name on the voucher at the time of providing it to make sure that the person buying the ticket is the one signing the voucher. So, if more than one Chefs enter the park, they can exchange their vouchers while they are inside the park.\n\n\nChefs thought of exploiting this flow. They wanted to buy minimum number of tickets. Can you help them in finding how many minimum tickets they should buy?\n\n\nLet us take an example. There are two Chef's, Alice and Bob. Alice wants to visit the park three times and Bob only once. For their first visits, each of them buys a ticket and obtains their vouchers and visits the park. After they have entered their park, Bob gives his voucher to Alice. Alice signs her name on her own voucher and on the voucher given by Bob. In this way, she has two vouchers, which she can use to visit the park two more times. So, in total by buying two tickets, Alice can visit three times and Bob once.\n\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains a single integer n denoting the number of Chefs.\nThe second line contains n space-separated integers t1, t2, ..., tn, where ti denotes the number of times i-th Chef wants to visit the park.\n\nOutput\nOutput a single integer corresponding to the minimum number of tickets Chefs needs to buy.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5\n1 \u2264 ti \u2264 10^4\n\n\nExample\nInput 1:\n2\n3 1\n\nOutput:\n2\n\nInput 2:\n4\n1 2 3 3\n\nOutput:\n5\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1. This example is already explained in the problem statement.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

Formally speaking, they can get away with all of the billion dollars right now, but after t minutes they can carry away only  1\u00a0billion\u00a0*\u00a0p^t dollars, where p is some non-negative constant less than or equal to unity, and at t = M, they get arrested and lose all the money.\nThey will not leave the vault until a decision on how to divide the money has been made.\n\nThe money division process proceeds in the following way: at the beginning of each minute starting from the 1^st (that is, t = 0), one of them proposes his own way to divide the booty.

He also has L pairs of integers (ik, jk). His task is to calculate Ai1, j1 + Ai2, j2 + ... + AiL, jL.\n\n\nUnfortunately, Mike forgot if Ai, j was a number in the i'th row and j'th column or vice versa, if Ai, j was a number in the j'th row and i'th column.\n\n\nSo, Mike decided to calculate both E1 = Ai1, j1 + Ai2, j2 + ... + AiL, jL and E2 = Aj1, i1 + Aj2, i2 + ... + AjL, iL. If it is impossible to calculate E1(i.e. one of the summands doesn't exist), then let's assume, that it is equal to -1. If it is impossible to calculate E2, then let's also assume, that it is equal to -1.\n\n\nYour task is to calculate max(E1, E2).\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers N and M, denoting the number of rows and the number of columns respectively.\nEach of next N lines contains M integers. The j'th integer in the (i + 1)'th line of the input denotes Ai, j.\n\n\nThe (N + 2)'th line contains an integer L, denoting the number of pairs of integers, that Mike has.\nEach of next L lines contains a pair of integers.

E1 = 2 + 5 = 7, E2 = 4 + 5 = 9. The answer is max(E1, E2) = max(7, 9) = 9;\n\n\nIn the second test case N equals to 1, M equals to 3, L equals to 2. It is impossible to calculate E1 and E2, because A3, 1 doesn't exist. So the answer is max(E1, E2) = max(-1, -1) = -1;\n\n\nIn the third test case N equals to 1, M equals to 3, L equals to 2. It is impossible to calculate E1, because A3, 1 doesn't exist. So E1 is equal to -1. E2 = 1 + 3 = 4. The answer is max(E1, E2) = max(-1,4) = 4.\n\n\nScoring\n\n1 \u2264 ik, jk \u2264 500 for each test case.\n\n\nSubtask 1 (10 points): 1 \u2264 N, M, L \u2264 5, 0 \u2264 Ai, j \u2264 10;\nSubtask 2 (12 points): 1 \u2264 N, M, L \u2264 300, 0 \u2264 Ai, j \u2264 10^6, all the numbers in A are equal;\nSubtask 3 (20 points): 1 \u2264 N, M, L \u2264 300, 0 \u2264 Ai, j \u2264 10^9;\nSubtask 4 (26 points): 1 \u2264 N, M, L \u2264 500, 0 \u2264 Ai, j \u2264 10^9;\nSubtask 5 (32 points): 1 \u2264 N, M \u2264 500, 1 \u2264 L \u2264 250 000, 0 \u2264 Ai, j \u2264 10^9.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

There are n appetizers numbered from 0 to n-1 such that if the appetizers are arrayed in this order, they will display the message. The Chef plans to display them in this order on a table that can be viewed by all guests as they enter. The appetizers will only be served once all guests are seated.\n\n\nThe appetizers are not necessarily finished in the same order as they are numbered. So, when an appetizer is finished the Chef will write the number on a piece of paper and place it beside the appetizer on a counter between the kitchen and the restaurant. A server will retrieve this appetizer and place it in the proper location according to the number written beside it.\n\n\nThe Chef has a penchant for binary numbers. The number of appetizers created is a power of 2, say n = 2^k. Furthermore, he has written the number of the appetizer in binary with exactly k bits. That is, binary numbers with fewer than k bits are padded on the left with zeros so they are written with exactly k bits.\n\n\nUnfortunately, this has unforseen complications. A binary number still \"looks\" binary when it is written upside down. For example, the binary number \"0101\" looks like \"1010\" when read upside down and the binary number \"110\" looks like \"011\" (the Chef uses simple vertical lines to denote a 1 bit). The Chef didn't realize that the servers would read the numbers upside down so he doesn't rotate the paper when he places it on the counter. Thus, when the server picks up an appetizer they place it the location indexed by the binary number when it is read upside down.\n\n\nYou are given the message the chef intended to display and you are to display the message that will be displayed after the servers move all appetizers to their locations based on the binary numbers they read.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line consists of a single integer T \u2264 25 indicating the number of test cases to follow.

Ann spent a lot of time trying to solve the problem... but all her attempts happened to be unsuccessful.

He wants to place N colored cherries around the cake in a circular manner. As all great chefs do, Doom doesn't want any two adjacent cherries to have the same color. Chef has unlimited supply of cherries of K \u2264 10 different colors. Each color is denoted by the digit from the set {0, 1, ..., K \u2013 1}. Different colors are denoted by different digits. Some of the cherries are already placed and the Chef wants you to place cherries in the remaining positions. He understands that there can be many such arrangements, so in the case when the answer is not unique he asks you to find the lexicographically smallest one.\n\n\nWhat does it mean?\n\n\nLet's numerate positions for the cherries by the numbers 1, 2, ..., N starting from one of the positions in a clockwise direction. Then the current (possibly partial) arrangement of the cherries can be represented by a string of N characters. For each position i of the arrangement if the cherry of the color C is placed at this position then the i^th character of the string is equal to the digit C. Otherwise, it is equal to the question mark ?. We identify the arrangement with the string that represents it.\n\n\nOne arrangement is called lexicographically smaller than the other arrangement if at the first position where they differ the first one has smaller digit (we compare only complete arrangements so we don't care about relation between digits and the question mark). For example, the arrangement 1230123 is lexicographically smaller than 1231230 since they have first 3 equal characters but the 4^th character in the first arrangement is 0 and it is less than 1 which is the 4^th character of the second arrangement.\n\n\nNotes\n\n\n The cherries at the first and the last positions are adjacent to each other (recall that we have a circular cake).\n In the case N = 1 any arrangement is valid as long as the color used for the only cherry of this arrangement is less than K.\n Initial arrangement can be already invalid (see the case 3 in the example).\n\n\n\n\nJust to make all things clear. You will be given a usual string of digits and question marks. Don't be confused by circular stuff we have in this problem. You don't have to rotate the answer once you have replaced all question marks by the digits. Think of the output like the usual string for which each two consecutive digits must be different but having additional condition that the first and the last digits must be also different (of course if N > 1).\n\n\nNext, you don't have to use all colors. The only important condition is that this string should be lexicographically smaller than all other strings that can be obtained from the input string by replacement of question marks by digits and of course it must satisfy conditions on adjacent digits.\n\n\nOne more thing, K here is not the length of the string but the number of allowed colors. Also we emphasize that the given string can have arbitrary number of question marks. So it can have zero number of question marks as well as completely consists of question marks but of course in general situation it can have both digits and question marks.\n\n\nOK. Let's try to formalize things in order to make all even more clear. You will be given an integer K and a string S=S[1]S[2]...S[N] where each S[i] is either the decimal digit less than K or the question mark. We are serious. In all tests string S can have only digits less than K. Don't ask about what to do if we have digit \u2265 K. There are no such tests at all! We guarantee this! OK, let's continue. Your task is to replace each question mark by some digit strictly less than K. If there were no question marks in the string skip this step. Now if N=1 then your string is already valid. For N > 1 it must satisfy the following N conditions S[1] \u2260 S[2], S[2] \u2260 S[3], ..., S[N-1] \u2260 S[N], S[N] \u2260 S[1]. Among all such valid strings that can be obtained by replacement of question marks you should choose lexicographically smallest one. I hope now the problem is really clear.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input file contains an integer T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. Each test case consists of exactly two lines. The first line contains an integer K, the number of available colors for cherries. The second line contains a string S that represents the current arrangement of the cherries in the cake.\n\n\nConstraints\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 1000\n1 \u2264 K \u2264 10\n1 \u2264 |S| \u2264 100, where |S| denotes the length of the string S\nEach character in S is either the digit from the set {0, 1, ..., K \u2013 1} or the question mark ?\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case output the lexicographically smallest valid arrangement of the cherries in the cake that can be obtained from the given arrangement by replacement of each question mark by some digit from 0 to K \u2013 1. If it is impossible to place the cherries output NO (output is case sensitive).\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n7\n1\n?\n2\n?0\n10\n79259?087\n2\n??\n3\n0?1\n4\n?????\n3\n012\n\nOutput:\n0\n10\nNO\n01\n021\n01012\n012\n\n\nExplanation\n\nCase 2. The only possible replacement here is 10. Note that we output 10 since we can not rotate the answer to obtain 01 which is smaller.\n\n\nCase 3. Arrangement is impossible because cherries at the first and the last positions are already of the same color. Note that K = 10 but the string has length 9. It is normal. K and |S| don't have any connection.\n\n\nCase 4. There are two possible arrangements: 01 and 10. The answer is the first one since it is lexicographically smaller.\n\n\nCase 5. There are three possible ways to replace question mark by the digit: 001, 011 and 021. But the first and the second strings are not valid arrangements as in both of them there exists an adjacent pair of cherries having the same color. Hence the answer is the third string.\n\n\nCase 6. Note that here we do not use all colors. We just find the lexicographically smallest string that satisfies condition on adjacent digit.\n\n\nCase 7. The string is already valid arrangement of digits. Hence we simply print the same string to the output.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

He got various orders to conduct the events from different organizations. In turn, Chef will receive a compensation depend upon the type of event and the total numbers of persons in the event. Chef has received N orders for conducting events in this weekend in all. As weekend consists of two days all events will take place during the period of 48 hours. For the i-th order the corresponding event will start at Si hours, ends at Ei hours and Chef will receive a compensation Ci for this event. For example, if Si = 17 and Ei = 22 then duration of event is 22 \u2013 17 = 5 hours and its time period is 17:00 \u2013 22:00 of Saturday. Hours of Sunday are numbered by numbers from 24 to 48. So, for example, 10:00 of Sunday will be represented as 10 + 24 = 34. Because Chef is a newbie, the organizations had put a condition that Chef will receive a compensation for the event if and only if he is available for the entire duration of the event. It means that he can not choose overlapping events. Note, however, that if some event starts just in the moment another event has finished the Chef can safely conduct them both.\n\n\nIn general Chef will obey the orders on first come first serve basis. But on weekends Chef will select the orders in such a way that the total compensation for all the events he will conduct will be the maximal. Now your task is to help Chef and find this maximal total compensation.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The first line of each test case contains an integer N, the number of received orders for conducting events. Each of the next N lines contains three space separated integers Si, Ei, Ci, the parameters of the i-th event described in the problem statement.\n\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 10\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 2000\n0 \u2264 Si < Ei \u2264 48\n0 \u2264 Ci \u2264 10^6\n\n\nOutput\n\nOutput for each test case should contain a single integer in a separate line, the maximal compensation Chef Po can get.\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n2\n4\n1 2 100\n2 3 200\n3 4 1600\n1 3 2100\n3\n1 10 2000\n2 5 100\n6 9 400\n\nOutput:\n3700\n2000\n\n\nExplanation\n\nCase 1. The best choice here is to conduct 3rd and 4th events. The total compensation is equal to 1600 + 2100 = 3700. These events do not overlap since 3rd event starts just after the finish of the 4th one. Alternatively we can conduct first three events that also do not overlap. But in this case compensation will be only 100 + 200 + 1600 = 1900.\n\n\nCase 2. Note that first event overlaps with both second and third events, while the last two events do not overlap. Hence there are two reasonable choices available for Chef. One is to take just the first order with total compensation 2000 and the second one is to take the last two orders with total compensation 100 + 400 = 500. Clearly the first choice is better. Hence the answer is 2000.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

    "prompt": "### Prompt\nA tourist is visiting Byteland. The tourist knows English very well. The language of Byteland is rather different from English. To be exact it differs in following points:\n\nBytelandian alphabet has the same letters as English one, but possibly different in meaning. Like 'A' in Bytelandian may be 'M' in English. However this does not mean that 'M' in Bytelandian must be 'A' in English. More formally, Bytelindian alphabet is a permutation of English alphabet. It will be given to you and could be any possible permutation. Don't assume any other condition.\nPeople of Byteland don't like to use invisible character for separating words. Hence instead of space (' ') they use underscore ('_'). Other punctuation symbols, like '?', '!' remain the same as in English.\n\nThe tourist is carrying \"The dummies guide to Bytelandian\", for translation. The book is serving his purpose nicely. But he is addicted to sharing on BaceFook, and shares his numerous conversations in Byteland on it. The conversations are rather long, and it is quite tedious to translate for his English friends, so he asks you to help him by writing a program to do the same.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T, denoting the length of the conversation, and the string M, denoting the English translation of Bytelandian string \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\". T and M are separated by exactly one space. Then T lines follow, each containing a Bytelandian sentence S which you should translate into English. See constraints for details.\n\nOutput\nFor each of the sentence in the input, output its English translation on a separate line. Replace each underscores ('_') with a space (' ') in the output. Each punctuation symbol (see below) should remain the same. Note that the uppercase letters in Bytelandian remain uppercase in English, and lowercase letters remain lowercase. See the example and its explanation for clarity.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 100\nM is a permutation of \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\"\nEach sentence is non-empty and contains at most 100 characters\nEach sentence may contain only lowercase letters ('a'-'z'), uppercase letters ('A'-'Z'), underscores ('_') and punctuation symbols: dot ('.'), comma (','), exclamation ('!'), question-mark('?')\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n5 qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\nPh\nPcssi\nBpke_kdc_epclc_jcijsc_mihyo?\nEpcf_kdc_liswhyo_EIED_hy_Vimcvpcn_Zkdvp_siyo_viyecle.\nIpp!\n\nOutput:\nHi\nHello\nWhat are these people doing?\nThey are solving TOTR in Codechef March long contest.\nOhh!\n\nExplanation\nThe string \"qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm\" means that 'a' in Bytelandian is 'q' in English, 'b' in Bytelandian is 'w' in English, 'c' in Bytelandian is 'e' in English and so on.Thus to translate \"Ph\" (first sentence in example) to English:1) We find that 'p' in Bytelandian means 'h' in English. So we replace 'P' with 'H'.2) Then we see that 'h' in Bytelandian means 'i' in English. So we replace 'h' with 'i'.3) Therefore, the translation is \"Hi\".\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

For an example,\nlet us look at permutations.\nA permutation of the integers 1 to n is an\nordering of\nthese integers. So the natural way to represent a permutation is\nto list the integers in this order. With n = 5, a\npermutation might look like 2, 3, 4, 5, 1. \nHowever, there is another possibility of representing a permutation:\nYou create a list of numbers where the i-th number is the\nposition of the integer i in the permutation. \nLet us call this second\npossibility an inverse permutation. The inverse permutation\nfor the sequence above is 5, 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\nAn ambiguous permutation is a permutation which cannot be\ndistinguished from its inverse permutation. The permutation 1, 4, 3, 2\nfor example is ambiguous, because its inverse permutation is the same.\nTo get rid of such annoying sample test cases, you have to write a\nprogram which detects if a given permutation is ambiguous or not.\n\n\nInput Specification\nThe input contains several test cases.\nThe first line of each test case contains an integer n\n(1 \u2264 n \u2264 100000).\nThen a permutation of the integers 1 to n follows\nin the next line.

Of course, you cannot see inside the box while choosing the ticket.\n\n\nIf you choose a Type-1 ticket, you are declared winner of Lucky Tickets and double your money.\nIf you choose a Type-2 ticket, you are declared loser of Lucky Tickets and lose all your money.\nIf you choose a Type-3 ticket, you have to try your fortune again and pick another ticket from the box and the selection process starts all over again.\n\nChef was able to convince the organizers of Lucky Tickets to let him go first and discard T4 tickets. This means that Chef makes T4 turns to choose exactly one ticket every turn, and despite what ticket he chose, he simply discards it. Chef also convinced the organizers to let Artem go right after he is finished.\nWhat is the probability that Artem will win?\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. Each test case will consist of four space separeted integers T1, T2, T3 and T4, respectively.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the probability that Artem will win. Your answer will be considered correct if it has an absolute error less then 10^-6.\n\nConstraints\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 10000\n1 \u2264 T1, T2, T3 \u2264 1000000000\n0 \u2264 T4 < T1 + T2\n\nSample\n\nInput\n2\n2 2 1 2\n2 3 4 1\n\nOutput\n0.5\n0.4\n\n\nExplanation\nIn the first test case, the 5 possible outcomes after Chef discards 2 tickets is\n\n\n(0,2,1) with probability (1/10). Probability of winning is 0 - since there are no winning tickets!\n(2,0,1) with probability (1/10). Probability of winning is 1 - since there are no losing tickets!\n(2,1,0) with probability (1/5). Probability of winning is (2/3) - there are no second chances!\n(1,2,0) with probability (1/5). Probability of winning is (1/3) - there are no second chances!\n(1,1,1) with probability (2/5). Probability of winning is (1/3) + (1/3)*(1/2) = (1/2). This is calculated by considering the two cases\n\nThe winning ticket is picked in the first turn - probability (1/3).\nA Type-3 ticket is picked in first turn, followed by the winning ticket - probability (1/3)*(1/2).\n\n\n\nThe over-all probability of winning is (1/10) + (2/15) + (1/15) + (1/5) = (1/2).\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

One day at a mobile recharge shop, he noticed that his service provider gives add-on plans which can lower his calling rates (Rokdas/minute). One of the plans said \"Recharge for 28 Rokdas and enjoy call rates of 0.50 Rokdas/min for one month\". Chef was very pleased. His normal calling rate is 1 Rokda/min. And he talked for 200 minutes in last month, which costed him 200 Rokdas. If he had this plan activated, it would have costed him: 28 + 0.5*200 = 128 Rokdas only! Chef could have saved 72 Rokdas. But if he pays for this add-on and talks for very little in the coming month, he may end up saving nothing or even wasting money. Now, Chef is a simple guy and he doesn't worry much about future. He decides to choose the plan based upon his last month\u2019s usage.\nThere are numerous plans. Some for 1 month, some for 15 months. Some reduce call rate to 0.75 Rokdas/min, some reduce it to 0.60 Rokdas/min. And of course each of them differ in their activation costs. Note - If a plan is valid for M months, then we must pay for (re)activation after every M months (once in M months). Naturally, Chef is confused, and you (as always) are given the task to help him choose the best plan.\n\nInput\nFirst line contains T- the number of test cases.

Now the factory is facing hard times, so currently they produce only the T-shirts of three kinds: red, green and blue T-Shirts. All the T-shirts are stored in the containers, each of the containers contain the T-Shirts of a single colour.\nNow there are N containers at the warehouse, lined up in a line. Let's enumerate the containers by the positive integers from 1 to N, starting from the leftmost and ending at the rightmost one. Their order is described with a string S. Each symbol of this string is either \"r\", \"g\" or \"b\" and denotes the colour of the respective T-shirts, stored in the container.\nOlya likes orderliness. She is not satisfied with the fact that different kinds of containers are messed up. So she wants to rearrange the containers in such a way that the number of pairs of adjacent containers that contain the T-shirts of different colors is as minimal as possible.\nFor doing that, she has a special crane. The crane is capable of doing the following things:\n\nTake a container with the number X and put it in front of all the containers. This operation takes (X-1) seconds. Note that we are considering the 1-dimensional model of the warehouse, so \"in front of all the containers\" means to the left of all the containers. The warehouse is so large, so you shouldn't worry about its' size and this operation is always performable.\nTake a container with the number X and take some container to the left of it (say, the container number Y). Remove the container number X from its' position and insert it right after the container with the number Y. This operation will take X-Y-1 seconds.\nTake a container with the number X and take some container to the right of it (say, the container number Y). Remove the container number X from its' position and insert it right after the container with the number Y. This operation will take Y-X seconds.\n\nNote that after the operation, we will re-enumerate the containers from left to right by the positive integers from 1 to N.\n \nThough Olya is keen on orderliness, she doesn't way to stay at the warehouse for long on Sunday. So she asks you to help her and to calculate the minimal possible number of seconds that is necessary to rearrange the containers in the desired way.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.

The description of T test cases follows.\n\nThe first line of each test contains two space separated integers N and M - the number of animals/items not including the boatman, and the number of relations of the form \"X will be eaten by Y\", respectively.\nThe following M lines contain pairs of the form X Y with the meaning that the X-th animal/item will be eaten by the Y-th one if they are both on the opposite bank to the boatman.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing either \"YES\" or \"NO\" - the answer to the question \"Is it possible to move them all to the opposite bank of the river in such a way that nobody/nothing gets eaten?\".\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 100000\nExample\nInput:\n2\n3 2\n1 2\n2 3\n3 3\n1 2\n2 3\n1 3\n\nOutput:\nYES\nNO\n\n\nExplanation\nThe first example is the original version of the problem.\nThe second example would have a solution if a boat could seat an additional animal/item.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

There are infinite number of unused cars, each of same model only differentiated by the their colors. The cars are of K colors.\n\n\nA zombie parent can give birth to any number of zombie-children (possibly zero), i.e. each zombie will have its parent except the head zombie which was born in the winters by combination of ice and fire.\n\n\nNow, zombies are having great difficulties to commute to their offices without cars, so they decided to use the cars available. Every zombie will need only one car. Head zombie called a meeting regarding this, in which he will allow each zombie to select a car for him.\n\n\nOut of all the cars, the head zombie chose one of cars for him. Now, he called his children to choose the cars for them. After that they called their children and so on till each of the zombie had a car. Head zombie knew that it won't be a good idea to allow children to have cars of same color as that of parent, as they might mistakenly use that. So, he enforced this rule during the selection of cars.\n\nProfessor James Moriarty is a criminal mastermind and has trapped Watson again in the zombie world. Sherlock somehow manages to go there and met the head zombie. Head zombie told Sherlock that they will let Watson free if and only if Sherlock manages to tell him the maximum number of ways in which the cars can be selected by N Zombies among all possible hierarchies. A hierarchy represents parent-child relationships among the N zombies. Since the answer may be large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7. Sherlock can not compute big numbers, so he confides you to solve this for him.\n\n\nInput\nThe first line consists of a single integer T, the number of test-cases.\nEach test case consists of two space-separated integers N and K, denoting number of zombies and the possible number of colors of the cars respectively.\n\n\nOutput\nFor each test-case, output a single line denoting the answer of the problem.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 100\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 10^9\n1 \u2264 K \u2264 10^9\n\n\nExample\nInput\n2\n2 2\n3 3\nOutput:\n2\n12\n\nExplanation\nIn the first sample test case, there are 2 zombies. Let us name them Z1 and Z2. Let one hierarchy be one in which Z1 is parent of Z2. There are 2 colors, suppose red and blue. If Z1 takes red, then Z2 should take a blue. If Z1 takes blue, then Z2 should take red. \nNote that one other possible hierarchy could be one in which Z2 is a parent of Z1. In that hierarchy also, number of possible ways of assigning cars is 2.\nSo there maximum number of possible ways is 2.\n\n\nIn the second example, we have 3 Zombies say Z1, Z2, Z3 and cars of 3 colors, suppose red, blue and green.\nA hierarchy to maximize the number of possibilities is Z1 is the parent of Z2, Z2 is the parent of Z3.\nZombie Z1 can choose one of red, blue or green cars. Z2 can choose one of the remaining two colors (as its car's color can not be same as its parent car.). Z3 can also choose his car in two colors, (one of them could be color same as Z1, and other being the color which is not same as cars of both Z1 and Z2.). This way, there can be 12 different ways of selecting the cars.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

The kingdom of Maahishmati had never lost a battle under him (as army-chief), and the reason for that was their really powerful army, also called as Mahasena.\nKattapa was known to be a very superstitious person. He believed that a soldier is \"lucky\" if the soldier is holding an even number of weapons, and \"unlucky\" otherwise. He considered the army as \"READY FOR BATTLE\" if the count of \"lucky\" soldiers is strictly greater than the count of \"unlucky\" soldiers, and \"NOT READY\" otherwise.\nGiven the number of weapons each soldier is holding, your task is to determine whether the army formed by all these soldiers is \"READY FOR BATTLE\" or \"NOT READY\".\nNote: You can find the definition of an even number here.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of input consists of a single integer N denoting the number of soldiers. The second line of input consists of N space separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN, where Ai denotes the number of weapons that the i^th soldier is holding.\n\nOutput\nGenerate one line output saying \"READY FOR BATTLE\", if the army satisfies the conditions that Kattapa requires or \"NOT READY\" otherwise (quotes for clarity).\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 100\n1 \u2264 Ai \u2264 100\n\n\nExample 1\nInput:\n1\n1\n\nOutput:\nNOT READY\n\nExample 2\nInput:\n1\n2\n\nOutput:\nREADY FOR BATTLE\n\nExample 3\nInput:\n4\n11 12 13 14\n\nOutput:\nNOT READY\n\nExample 4\nInput:\n3\n2 3 4\n\nOutput:\nREADY FOR BATTLE\n\nExample 5\nInput:\n5\n1 2 3 4 5\n\nOutput:\nNOT READY\n\nExplanation\n\n\nExample 1: For the first example, N = 1 and the array A = [1]. There is only 1 soldier and he is holding 1 weapon, which is odd. The number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons = 0, and number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons = 1. Hence, the answer is \"NOT READY\" since the number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons is not greater than the number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons.\nExample 2: For the second example, N = 1 and the array A = [2]. There is only 1 soldier and he is holding 2 weapons, which is even. The number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons = 1, and number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons = 0. Hence, the answer is \"READY FOR BATTLE\" since the number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons is greater than the number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons.\nExample 3: For the third example, N = 4 and the array A = [11, 12, 13, 14]. The 1^st soldier is holding 11 weapons (which is odd), the 2^nd soldier is holding 12 weapons (which is even), the 3^rd soldier is holding 13 weapons (which is odd), and the 4^th soldier is holding 14 weapons (which is even). The number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons = 2, and number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons = 2. Notice that we have an equal number of people holding even number of weapons and odd number of weapons. The answer here is \"NOT READY\" since the number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons is not strictly greater than the number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons.\nExample 4: For the fourth example, N = 3 and the array A = [2, 3, 4]. The 1^st soldier is holding 2 weapons (which is even), the 2^nd soldier is holding 3 weapons (which is odd), and the 3^rd soldier is holding 4 weapons (which is even). The number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons = 2, and number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons = 1. Hence, the answer is \"READY FOR BATTLE\" since the number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons is greater than the number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons.\nExample 5: For the fifth example, N = 5 and the array A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The 1^st soldier is holding 1 weapon (which is odd), the 2^nd soldier is holding 2 weapons (which is even), the 3^rd soldier is holding 3 weapons (which is odd), the 4^th soldier is holding 4 weapons (which is even), and the 5^th soldier is holding 5 weapons (which is odd). The number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons = 2, and number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons = 3. Hence, the answer is \"NOT READY\" since the number of soldiers holding an even number of weapons is not greater than the number of soldiers holding an odd number of weapons.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

I guess its hard to code while thinking of Samosa, especially if you are very hungry now ; so lets not get in to any recipe or eating game. \n\nYou have N  boxes of Samosas, where each box is a cube. To pack a box, you need to use a rubber band ( pseudo-circular, elastic band ) by placing it around the box ( along 4 faces of the cube ).  A (R1,R2)-rubber band has initial radius R1 and it can stretch at max to radius R2 without breaking. You can pack a cubical box of side length L using a rubber band of circumference 4 * L ( see Notes for clarity). Given M rubber bands along with their initial radius and max radius, we need to match ( assign ) some rubber bands to boxes. A box needs at least one rubber band to pack it and of course, each rubber band can be used to pack at most one box. Find the maximum number of boxes we can pack.\n\n\nNotesA pseudo-circular rubber band having a radius R has circumference of 2 * K * R , where K is a constant = 22 / 7. So, a (R1,R2) rubber band can be used to pack a cubical box of side length L, only if 2 * K * R1 <= 4 * L <= 2 * K * R2\n\nInput\nFirst line contains an integer T ( number of test cases, around 20 ). T cases follow. Each test case starts with an integer N ( number of boxes, 1 <= N <= 1000 ). Next line contains N integers, the side lengths L of the N boxes ( 1 <= L <= 100,000,000 ). Next line contains an integer M ( number of rubber bands, 1 <= M <= 1000 ). Each of the next M lines contains two integers R1 R2 ( 1 <= R1 <= R2 <= 100,000,000 ), separated by a space.\n\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output the maximum number of boxes you can pack, in a new line.\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n1\n4\n10 20 34 55\n4\n7 14\n7 21\n14 21\n7 35\n\nOutput:\n2\n\n\nExplanation:\nOnly 1 test case here, and a possible answer can be, using (7,14) rubber band to pack box L = 10, and using (7,35) rubber band to pack box L = 55. We cannot pack more than 2 boxes.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

The bigger problem is that he needs to get his tractor out of the cave (don't ask why Chef owns a tractor!). He currently faces a large block of height N cells and length N cells, and needs to get his tractor across this block. The block is made up of vertical columns of soil, each of which is one cell long. Each column has a continuous vertical gap, with the i^th column having its gap from the li^th cell to the hi^th cell (starting from the bottom, 0-indexing). That is, in the i^th column, there is no soil from the li^th cell to the hi^th cell (both inclusive). Chef can build additional gaps by clearing some cells of soil. His tractor has height H, and therefore, he needs to build a horizontal corridor of height H passing through all the columns. That is, some consecutive H rows must have no soil. Please see the figures in the example and explanation sections for more details.\nChef is able to clear one cell of soil by spending one unit of energy. Chef is smart, and will figure out a way to build the horizontal corridor while spending the minimum possible amount of energy. To estimate how many of his tasty dishes he will still be able to cook for you tonight, find out what is the minimum possible energy he needs to spend.\n\nInput\nFirst line of input contains one integer T - number of test cases.

Their entangling and mesmerizing game style usually translates into very high ball possession, consecutive counter-attack plays and goals. Lots of goals, thanks to the natural talent of their attacker and best player in history, Lionel Andres Messi.\nHowever, at the most prestigious tournament of individual teams, the UEFA Champions League, there are no guarantees and believe it or not, Barcelona is in trouble.... They are tied versus Chelsea, which is a very defending team that usually relies on counter-strike to catch opposing teams off guard and we are in the last minute of the match. So Messi decided to settle things down for good and now he is conducting the ball on his teams' midfield and he will start a lethal counter-attack :D\nAfter dribbling the 2 strikers from Chelsea, he now finds himself near the center of the field and he won't be able to dribble the entire team on his own, so he will need to pass the ball to one of his teammates, run forward and receive the ball once again to score the final goal.\nExactly K players are with him on his counter-attack and the coach, Tito Villanova knows that this counter-attack will end in a goal only if after exactly N passes are performed between the players, Messi ends up with the ball.\n (Note that the ball only needs to end with Messi after exactly N passes are performed between all the K+1 players, i.e. Messi can receive the ball several times during the N passes. See the 2nd test case explanation for further clarification. ) \nHowever, he realized that there are many scenarios possible for this, so he asked you, his assistant coach, to tell him in how many ways can Messi score the important victory goal. So help him!!\n\nInput\nInput will contain a number T denoting the number of test cases.\nThen T test cases follow, each one consisting of two space-sparated integers N and K.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single integer, the number of ways the winning play might happen modulo 1000000007 (10^9+7).\n\nConstraints\n\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 100\n2 \u2264 N \u2264 1000\n1 \u2264 K \u2264 10\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n2\n2 4\n4 2\n\nOutput:\n4\n6\n\nExplanation\nIn the first test case, say four players with Messi are Xavi, Busquets, Iniesta and Jordi Alba.

Let R[i] to be the result of breathalyzer test of i-th elephant.\nConsidering current laws in the Zoo, elephants would be arrested if there exists K consecutive elephants among them for which at least M of these K elephants have the maximal test result among these K elephants.\nUsing poor math notations we can alternatively define this as follows. The elephants would be arrested if there exists i from 0 to N-K, inclusive, such that for at least M different values of j from i to i+K-1, inclusive, we have R[j] = max{R[i], R[i+1], ..., R[i+K-1]}.\n\nThe Big Hippo is very old and the Little Elephant can change some of the results. In a single operation he can add 1 to the result of any elephant. But for each of the elephants he can apply this operation at most once.\nWhat is the minimum number of operations that the Little Elephant needs to apply, such that the sequence of results, after all operations will be applied, let elephants to avoid the arrest? If it is impossible to avoid the arrest applying any number of operations, output -1.\n\nInput\n The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.

The second line contains N space-separated integers  R[0], R[1], ..., R[N-1] denoting the test results of the elephants.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the minimum number of operations needed to avoid the arrest.\n\nConstraints\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 10\n1 \u2264 M \u2264 K \u2264 N \u2264 17\n1 \u2264 R[i] \u2264 17\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n4\n5 3 2\n1 3 1 2 1\n5 3 3\n7 7 7 7 7\n5 3 3\n7 7 7 8 8\n4 3 1\n1 3 1 2\n\nOutput:\n0\n1\n1\n-1\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1. Let's follow the poor math definition of arrest. We will consider all values of i from 0 to N-K = 2, inclusive, and should count the number of values of j described in the definition. If it less than M = 2 then this value of i does not cause the arrest, otherwise causes.\n\n\ni\n{R[i],...,R[i+K-1]}\nmax{R[i],...,R[i+K-1]}\nFor which j = i, ..., i+K-1 we have R[j] = max\nConclusion\n\n\ni=0\n{1, 3, 1}\nmax = 3\nR[j] = 3 for j = 1\ndoes not cause the arrest\n\n\ni=1\n{3, 1, 2}\nmax = 3\nR[j] = 3 for j = 1\ndoes not cause the arrest\n\n\ni=2\n{1, 2, 1}\nmax = 2\nR[j] = 2 for j = 3\ndoes not cause the arrest\n\n\nSo we see that initial test results of the elephants do not cause their arrest. Hence the Little Elephant does not need to apply any operations. Therefore, the answer is 0.\nExample case 2.We have N = 5, K = 3, M = 3. Let's construct similar table as in example case 1. Here the value of i will cause the arrest if we have at least 3 values of j described in the definition.\n\n\ni\n{R[i],...,R[i+K-1]}\nmax{R[i],...,R[i+K-1]}\nFor which j = i, ..., i+K-1 we have R[j] = max\nConclusion\n\n\ni=0\n{7, 7, 7}\nmax = 7\nR[j] = 7 for j = 0, 1, 2\ncauses the arrest\n\n\ni=1\n{7, 7, 7}\nmax = 7\nR[j] = 7 for j = 1, 2, 3\ncauses the arrest\n\n\ni=2\n{7, 7, 7}\nmax = 7\nR[j] = 7 for j = 2, 3, 4\ncauses the arrest\n\n\nSo we see that for initial test results of the elephants each value of i causes their arrest. Hence the Little Elephant needs to apply some operations in order to avoid the arrest. He could achieve his goal by adding 1 to the result R[2]. Then results will be {R[0], R[1], R[2], R[3], R[4]} = {7, 7, 8, 7, 7}. Let's check that now elephants will be not arrested.\n\n\ni\n{R[i],...,R[i+K-1]}\nmax{R[i],...,R[i+K-1]}\nFor which j = i, ..., i+K-1 we have R[j] = max\nConclusion\n\n\ni=0\n{7, 7, 8}\nmax = 8\nR[j] = 8 for j = 2\ndoes not cause the arrest\n\n\ni=1\n{7, 8, 7}\nmax = 8\nR[j] = 8 for j = 2\ndoes not cause the arrest\n\n\ni=2\n{8, 7, 7}\nmax = 8\nR[j] = 8 for j = 2\ndoes not cause the arrest\n\n\nSo we see that now test results of the elephants do not cause their arrest. Thus we see that using 0 operations we can't avoid the arrest but using 1 operation can. Hence the answer is 1.\nExample case 3.We have N = 5, K = 3, M = 3. Let's construct similar table as in example case 1. Here the value of i will cause the arrest if we have at least 3 values of j described in the definition.\n\n\ni\n{R[i],...,R[i+K-1]}\nmax{R[i],...,R[i+K-1]}\nFor which j = i, ..., i+K-1 we have R[j] = max\nConclusion\n\n\ni=0\n{7, 7, 7}\nmax = 7\nR[j] = 7 for j = 0, 1, 2\ncauses the arrest\n\n\ni=1\n{7, 7, 8}\nmax = 8\nR[j] = 8 for j = 3\ndoes not cause the arrest\n\n\ni=2\n{7, 8, 8}\nmax = 8\nR[j] = 8 for j = 3, 4\ndoes not cause the arrest\n\n\nSo we see that for initial test results of the elephants the value of i = 0 causes their arrest. Hence the Little Elephant needs to apply some operations in order to avoid the arrest. He could achieve his goal by adding 1 to the result R[1]. Then results will be {R[0], R[1], R[2], R[3], R[4]} = {7, 8, 7, 8, 8}.

Thus we see that using 0 operations we can't avoid the arrest but using 1 operation can. Hence the answer is 1. Note that if we increase by 1 the result R[2] instead of R[1] then the value i = 2 will cause the arrest since {R[2], R[3], R[4]} will be {8, 8, 8} after this operation and we will have 3 values of j from 2 to 4, inclusive, for which R[j] = max{R[2], R[3], R[4]}, namely, j = 2, 3, 4.\nExample case 4. When M = 1 the Little Elephant can't reach the goal since for each value of i from 0 to N-K we have at least one value of j for which R[j] = max{R[i], R[i+1], ..., R[i+K-1]}.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

The other numbers are written according to an inductive rule \u2014 after Ai-1 numbers have been written in a row, then Ai can be written at either end of the row. That is, you first write A0, and then A1 can be written on its left or right to make A0A1 or A1A0, and so on.\nAi must be written before writing Aj, for every i < j.\nFor a move in which you write a number Ai (i>0), your points increase by the product of Ai and its neighbour. (Note that for any move it will have only one neighbour as you write the number at an end).\nTotal score of a game is the score you attain after placing all the N + 1 numbers.\n\nPrincess Rupsa wants to find out the sum of scores obtained by all possible different gameplays.

The rules of this competition are quite simple.\n\n Each participant needs to bring his or her best dish. The judges will initially assign a score to each of the dishes. Now, several rounds will follow. In each round, any two chefs will be called up on the stage. Each of the chefs can then choose any one dish to battle against the other chef and the one having the dish with the higher score will win this round. The winner of the round will also obtain all the dishes of the loser who will then be eliminated. In case both the dishes have equal scores, this round will be considered as a tie and nothing else will happen. Note that initially each chef will have only one dish and all the chefs play the rounds optimally.\n\n Your task is to simulate and answer some queries related to this. You will be given N dishes numbered from 1 to N with the i^th dish belonging to the i^th chef initially. You will also be given an array S where S[i] denotes the score given by the judges to the i^th dish before starting the rounds. You will have to answer Q queries, each of which can be of the following types :  \n1.  0 x y : This denotes that the chef containing dish number x  competes with the chef containing dish number  y  currently in this round. If a single chef is the owner of both the dishes, print \"Invalid query!\" (without quotes), otherwise execute and store the result of this round as described by the rules above.  \n2.  1 x  : You need to output the index of the chef containing dish x  at this point.\n\nInput\nFirst line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. For each test case, the first line contains an integer N denoting the number of chefs in the contest. The next line contains N space separated integers where the i^th integer represents S[i].

Archer, being as intelligent as he is, came up with the following plan:\nA man with name M is allowed to marry a woman with name W, only if M is a subsequence of W or W is a subsequence of M.\nA is said to be a subsequence of B, if A can be obtained by deleting some elements of B without changing the order of the remaining elements.\nYour task is to determine whether a couple is allowed to marry or not, according to Archer's rule.\n\nInput\nThe first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. Each test case contains two space separated strings M and W.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case print \"YES\" if they are allowed to marry, else print \"NO\".

So, S[0] = 'j', S[1] = 'o', S[2] = 'h' and so on. If we remove the indices [3, 4, 6] or [3, 5, 6] from S, it becomes \"john\". Hence \"john\" is a subsequence of S, so the answer is \"YES\".\nCase 2: Any string is a subsequence of it self, as it is formed after removing \"0\" characters. Hence the answer is \"YES\".\nCase 3: \"jayla\" can not be attained from \"kayla\" as removing any character from \"kayla\" would make the string length smaller than \"jayla\", also there is no 'j' in \"kayla\". Similar reasoning can be applied to see why \"kayla\" can't be attained from \"jayla\". Hence the answer is \"NO\".\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

They would just attack the enemy randomly and overpower them with sheer number of soldiers. However, we all know that Baahubali and Bhallaladeva defeated the Kalakeyas by following the Thrishul strategy, and successfully defended their kingdom Maahishmati. We also know that Baahubali was very smart, and the truth is that he predicted how the Kalakeyas would attack and  devised a counter strategy for the same, the night before the war. This is what he found:\nThe Kalakeyas had N forts, numbered 1 to N and Baahubali had N soldiers, numbered 1 to N. Baahubali discovered that he can permute his soldiers in any way to get a permutation of 1 to N => P1, P2, ..., PN. He would then send his soldiers to attack the forts in the following way: soldier P1 attacks fort 1, soldier P2 attacks fort 2, ..., soldier PN attacks fort N. It is easy to note that each soldier attacks exactly one fort and no two soldiers attack the same fort. Baahubali also got to know about a secret key of the Kalakeyas, which is an integer K. A soldier X can destroy a fort Y, iff abs(X - Y) \u2265 K. For more details on the abs() function, check here.\n\nYour task is to determine whether Baahubali's soldiers can be permuted in some way, such that all forts can be destroyed. In other words, for a permutation P1, P2, ..., PN, Baahubali's soldiers can destroy all the forts iff abs(Pi - i) \u2265 K, for all 1 <= i <= N. If this is possible, you are also required to output the lexicographically smallest such permutation. If it is not possible, output -1.\n\nNote: A permutation A1, A2, ..., AN is said to be lexicographically smaller than a permutation B1, B2, ..., BN, if and only if at the first i where Ai and Bi differ, Ai comes before Bi. You can refer here for a more detailed definition of lexicographic ordering.\n\n\nInput\nThe first line of input consists of a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each of the following T lines contain two space separated integers N and K denoting the values mentioned in the statement above.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing N space separated integers (which should be a permutation of [1..N], if Baahubali's soldiers can break all the forts. If it is not possible to break all the forts, output \"-1\" (quotes for clarity).\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 1000\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 10^5\n0 \u2264 K \u2264 N\nThe sum of N over all test cases in a single test file will not exceed 10^5\n\n\nExample\nInput:\n3\n2 2\n3 0\n3 1\n\nOutput:\n-1\n1 2 3\n2 3 1\n\nExplanation\nFor the first test case, N = 2 and K = 2. It is impossible to permute [1, 2] in any way such that abs(P[1]-1) \u2265 2 and abs(P[2]-2) \u2265 2. Hence, output is -1.\nFor the second test case, N = 3 and K = 0. We can just set P[i] = i, and hence the answer is 1 2 3\nFor the third case, the valid permutations are [2, 3, 1] and [3, 1, 2]. The answer is [2, 3, 1] since it is lexicographically smaller than [3, 1, 2].\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

How it will happen?\nChef arranges the N robots in a row, in the (increasing) order of their indices. Then, he chooses the first M robots and moves them to the end of the queue. Now, Chef goes to the robot at the first position in the row and hands it one cake. He then notes this robot's index (say k) in his notebook, and goes to the k^th position in the row. If the robot at this position does not have a cake, he give him one cake, notes his index in his notebook, and continues the same process. If a robot visited by Chef already has a cake with it, then he stops moving and the cake assignment process is stopped.\nChef will be satisfied if all robots have a cake in the end. In order to prepare the kitchen staff for Chef's wrath (or happiness :) ), you must find out if he will be satisfied or not? If not, you have to find out how much robots have a cake, so that the kitchen staff can prepare themselves accordingly.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases.\nThe single line of each test cases contains two space separated integers N and M.\n\n\nOutput\nFor each of the T test cases, output a single line:\n\nIf all N robots have a cake, output \"Yes\" (without quotes).\nOtherwise, output \"No\" (without quotes) followed by a space and the number of robots which have a cake.\n\n\nConstraints and Example\nInput:\n3\n2 0\n2 1\n4 2\n\nOutput:\nNo 1\nYes\nNo 2\n\n\nExplanation\nIn test case 1, we have two robots indexed 1 and 2. They are arranged as (1 2). Chef goes to the first robot, gives him a cake, and moves to position 1. In the next step, he sees that robot at this position already has a has cake. So Chef stops moving, and our answer is \"No 1\".\nIn test case 2, we again have two robots indexed 1 and 2. Initially, they are arranged as (1 2). Then, Chef moves robot#1 to the end of the row, and thus the arrangement becomes (2 1). Chef goes to the robot at the first position, which is robot#2. Chef hands him a cake, and moves to position 2. Then, he hands a cake to robot#1 at position 2, and moves back to the first position. Since, robot#2 at the first position already ahs a cake, Chef stops moving. All N robots have cakes, so Chef is satisfied, and our answer is \"Yes\".\nIn the 3^rd test case, we have the following arrangement of robots: (3 4 1 2). Only robots with indices 3 and 1 will get cakes. So our answer is \"No 2\".\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

The time shown above (3:33) is an example of such a situation. Other examples are 2:2 and 1:11. Note that the digits of 33:33 are identical, but it is not a valid time on a usual digital clock.\nThe above example was for a usual 24-hour format digital clock. Let's consider a more general clock, where an hour lasts M minutes and a day lasts H hours (therefore, the clock can show any number of hours between 0 and H-1, inclusive, and any number of minutes between 0 and M-1, inclusive). Both the hours and the minutes are shown without leading zeroes in decimal notation and their separator (e.g., ':') doesn't matter.\nCan you tell how many minutes during a day will the digital clock have identical digits displayed on it?\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T - the number of test cases.\nEach of the next T lines contains two space-separated integers H and M for one test case.\n\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line corresponding to the answer of the problem.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 50\n1 \u2264 H, M \u2264 100\n\n\nExample\nInput:\n6\n24 60\n34 50\n10 11\n10 12\n11 11\n1 1\n\nOutput:\n19\n20\n10\n11\n10\n1\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1.

So, there are 19 minutes during which the time displayed by the clock will have identical digits. \nExample case 2. Compared to the previous case, the clock doesn't show 5:55, but can show 33:3 and 33:33.\nExample case 6. In this example, our day consists of one hour and one hour consists of one minute. Hence, the entire day is just 1 minute - the only time the digital clock will display is 0:0 during the entire day, (i.e. the entire hour, i.e. entire minute). And 0:0 has all digits identical, so the answer is 1.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

With the help of this stone, he can multiply a number by any lucky number. Also, the magic stone can be used any number of times (possibly zero or infinite number of times). For example, if initially he has the number 1, then he can get numbers like 28 (formed by 1*4*7), 14476 (formed as 1*47*77*4) etc.\nNa2a has N numbers in his bag which are denoted by array A. For each number Ai in his bag, he asks you to transform it to a number with maximum possible number of trailing zeroes by using Magic Stone. You have to find the smallest of such numbers, since there can be multiple numbers with the maximum possible number of trailing zeros.\n\nInput\n\nThere is a single test case.\nFirst line contains a single integer N as stated in the problem.\nThe second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ... , AN where Ai denotes the i^th number in the bag.\n\n\nOutput\n\nOutput N lines, in which i^th line contains the answer corresponding to the number Ai.\n\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 N \u2264 10^5\n1 \u2264 Ai \u2264 10^9 \n\n\nExample\nInput:\r\n2\r\n2 15\r\n\r\nOutput:\r\n2\r\n60\r\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1.

The output of an AND gate is 1 if both inputs are 1, otherwise the output is 0. The output of an OR gate is 1 if at least one input is 1, otherwise the output is 0.\n\n\nYou are given a digital circuit composed of only AND and OR gates where one node (gate or input) is specially designated as the output. Furthermore, for any gate G and any input node I, at most one of the inputs to G depends on the value of node I.\n\n\nNow consider the following random experiment. Fix some probability p in [0,1] and set each input bit to 1 independently at random with probability p (and to 0 with probability 1-p). The output is then 1 with some probability that depends on p. You wonder what value of p causes the circuit to output a 1 with probability 1/2.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line indicates the number of test cases to follow (about 100).\n\n\nEach test case begins with a single line containing a single integer n with 1 \u2264 n \u2264 100 indicating the number of nodes (inputs and gates) in the circuit. Following this, n lines follow where the i'th line describes the i'th node. If the node is an input, the line simply consists of the integer 0. Otherwise, if the node is an OR gate then the line begins with a 1 and if the node is an AND gate then the line begins with a 2. In either case, two more integers a,b follow, both less than i, which indicate that the outputs from both a and b are used as the two input to gate i.\n\n\nAs stated before, the circuit will be such that no gate has both of its inputs depending on the value of a common input node.\n\n\nTest cases are separated by a blank line including a blank line preceding the first test case.\n\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case you are to output a single line containing the value p for which the output of node n is 1 with probability exactly 1/2 if the inputs are independently and randomly set to value 1 with probability p.

    "prompt": "### Prompt\nRecently, Chef got obsessed with piano. He is a just a rookie in this stuff and can not move his fingers from one key to other fast enough. He discovered that the best way to train finger speed is to play scales.\nThere are different kinds of scales which are divided on the basis of their interval patterns. For instance, major scale is defined by pattern T-T-S-T-T-T-S, where \u2018T\u2019 stands for a whole tone whereas \u2018S\u2019 stands for a semitone. Two semitones make one tone. To understand how they are being played, please refer to the below image of piano\u2019s octave \u2013 two consecutive keys differ by one semitone.\nIf we start playing from first key (note C), then we\u2019ll play all white keys in a row (notes C-D-E-F-G-A-B-C \u2013 as you can see C and D differ for a tone as in pattern, and E and F differ for a semitone).\nThis pattern could be played some number of times (in cycle).\n\nEach time Chef takes some type of a scale and plays using some number of octaves. Sometimes Chef can make up some scales, so please don\u2019t blame him if you find some scale that does not exist in real world.\nFormally, you have a set of 12 keys (i.e. one octave) and you have N such sets in a row. So in total, you have 12*N keys. You also have a pattern that consists of letters 'T' and 'S', where 'T' means move forward for two keys (from key x to key x + 2, and 'S' means move forward for one key (from key x to key x + 1).\nNow, you can start playing from any of the 12*N keys. In one play, you can repeat the pattern as many times as you want, but you cannot go outside the keyboard.\nRepeating pattern means that if, for example, you have pattern STTST, you can play STTST as well as STTSTSTTST, as well as STTSTSTTSTSTTST, as well as any number of repeating. For this pattern, if you choose to repeat it once, if you start at some key x, you'll press keys: x (letter 'S')-> x + 1 (letter 'T')-> x + 3 (letter 'T')-> x + 5 (letter 'S') -> x + 6 (letter 'T')-> x + 8. Also 1 \u2264 x, x + 8 \u2264 12*N so as to avoid going off the keyboard.\nYou are asked to calculate number of different plays that can be performed. Two plays differ if and only if they start at different keys or patterns are repeated different number of times.\n\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nFirst line of each test case contains scale\u2019s pattern \u2013 string s consisting of letters \u2018T\u2019 and \u2018S\u2019 only.\nSecond line contains one integer N \u2013 number of octaves he\u2019ll be using.\n\n\nOutput\nFor each test case output a single number in a line corresponding to number of different scales he\u2019ll play.\u00a0\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 10^5\n1 \u2264 |S| \u2264 100\n1 \u2264 n \u2264 7\n\n\nExample\nInput:\n2 \nTTTT\n1\nTTSTTTS\n3\n\nOutput:\n4\n36\n\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1.

    "prompt": "### Prompt\nOnce Chef decided to divide the tangerine into several parts. At first, he numbered tangerine's segments from 1 to n in the clockwise order starting from some segment. Then he intended to divide the fruit into several parts. In order to do it he planned to separate the neighbouring segments in k places, so that he could get k parts: the 1^st - from segment l1 to segment r1 (inclusive), the 2^nd - from l2 to r2, ..., the k^th - from lk to rk (in all cases in the clockwise order). Suddenly, when Chef was absent, one naughty boy came and divided the tangerine into p parts (also by separating the neighbouring segments one from another): the 1^st - from segment a1 to segment b1, the 2^nd - from a2 to b2, ..., the p^th - from ap to bp (in all cases in the clockwise order). Chef became very angry about it! But maybe little boy haven't done anything wrong, maybe everything is OK? Please, help Chef to determine whether he is able to obtain the parts he wanted to have (in order to do it he can divide p current parts, but, of course, he can't join several parts into one).\n Please, note that parts are not cyclic. That means that even if the tangerine division consists of only one part, but that part include more than one segment, there are two segments which were neighbouring in the initial tangerine but are not neighbouring in the division. See the explanation of example case 2 to ensure you understood that clarification.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains three space separated integers n, k, p, denoting the number of tangerine's segments and number of parts in each of the two divisions. The next k lines contain pairs of space-separated integers li and ri. The next p lines contain pairs of space-separated integers ai and bi.\nIt is guaranteed that each tangerine's segment is contained in exactly one of the first k parts and in exactly one of the next p parts.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing either \"Yes\" or \"No\" (without the quotes), denoting whether Chef is able to obtain the parts he wanted to have.\n\u00a0\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 100\n1 \u2264 n \u2264 5 * 10^7\n1 \u2264 k \u2264 min(500, n)\n1 \u2264 p \u2264 min(500, n)\n1 \u2264 li, ri, ai, bi \u2264 n\n\n\u00a0\n\nExample\nInput:\n2\n10 3 2\n1 4\n5 5\n6 10\n1 5\n6 10\n10 3 1\n2 5\n10 1\n6 9\n1 10\n\nOutput:\nYes\nNo\n\u00a0\n\nExplanation\nExample case 1: To achieve his goal Chef should divide the first part (1-5) in two by separating segments 4 and 5 one from another.\nExample case 2: The boy didn't left the tangerine as it was (though you may thought that way), he separated segments 1 and 10 one from another.

Rolls are made by a newly invented cooking machine. The machine is pretty universal - it can make lots of dishes and Chefza is thrilled about this.\nTo make a roll, Chefza has to set all the settings to specified integer values. There are lots of settings, each of them set to some initial value. The machine is pretty complex and there is a lot of cooking to be done today, so Chefza has decided to use only two quick ways to change the settings. In a unit of time, he can pick one setting (let's say its current value is v) and change it in one of the following ways.\n\nIf v is even, change this setting to v/2. If v is odd, change it to (v \u2212 1)/2.\nChange setting to 2 \u00d7 v\n\nThe receipt is given as a list of integer values the settings should be set to. It is guaranteed that each destination setting can be represented as an integer power of 2.\nSince Chefza has just changed his profession, he has a lot of other things to do.

She has not enough money to buy the new one so she bought some old neon signboard through the internet. Ciel was quite disappointed when she received her order - some of its letters were broken. But she realized that this is even better - she could replace each broken letter by any letter she wants. So she decided to do such a replacement that the resulting signboard will contain the word \"CHEF\" as many times as possible.\nWe can model the signboard as a string S having capital letters from 'A' to 'Z', inclusive, and question marks '?'. Letters in the string indicate the intact letters at the signboard, while question marks indicate broken letters. So Ciel will replace each question mark with some capital letter and her goal is to get the string that contains as many substrings equal to \"CHEF\" as possible. If there exist several such strings, she will choose the lexicographically smallest one.\nNote 1. The string S = S1...SN has the substring \"CHEF\" if for some i we have SiSi+1Si+2Si+3 = \"CHEF\". The number of times \"CHEF\" is the substring of S is the number of those i for which SiSi+1Si+2Si+3 = \"CHEF\".\nNote 2. The string A = A1...AN is called lexicographically smaller than the string B = B1...BN if there exists K from 1 to N, inclusive, such that Ai = Bi for i = 1, ..., K-1, and AK < BK. In particular, A is lexicographically smaller than B if A1 < B1. We compare capital letters by their positions in the English alphabet. So 'A' is the smallest letter, 'B' is the second smallest letter, ..., 'Z' is the largest letter.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The only line of each test case contains a string S.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, output a single line containing the content of the signboard Chef Ciel will come up with.

Here the resulting string can have at most 2 substrings equal to \"CHEF\". For example, some possible such strings are:\n\nCHEFCIELISACHEF\nCHEFCIELISQCHEF\nCHEFCIELISZCHEF\n\nHowever, lexicographically smallest one is the first one.\nExample Case 3. Here the resulting string cannot have \"CHEF\" as its substring.

    "prompt": "### Prompt\nYou are in charge of painting the lanes on a 500 meter race track for a forthcoming amateur track event. There are 9 lanes in total which means you must paint 10 lines around the track to delimit these lanes. Fortunately, you have special equipment that will help you paint these lanes very quickly.\n\n\nThis equipment has 10 paint nozzles arranged in a line and the spacing between consecutive nozzles is exactly equal to the width of a lane. So, all you have to do is drag this equipment around the track once while all 10 nozzles are spraying to paint all of the lines that delimit the lanes.\n\n\nUnfortunately, the equipment is a old and the paint doesn't apply evenly. Specifically, an air bubble can appear in a nozzle's paint supply line causing the nozzle to spray air instead of paint for a while. Since this event is not professional, it is ok to have some parts of the lines missing as long as each racer always has one of its two sides painted at any point on the track.\n\n\nYou only realized this after you finished dragging the equipment around the track. The equipment has some basic computing power and sensors and it was able to record when a nozzle was not working properly due to a paint bubble. So, instead of walking over the entire track, you can analyze the data. Your boss wants to know precisely how many meters out of the 500 meters of the race track are such that every lane has at least one of its sides painted along that meter.\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains a single integer T \u2264 30 indicating the number of test cases. Each test case begins with a single integer B indicating the number of bubbles that were recorded by the equipment's computer.\n\n\nThen B lines follow with 0 \u2264 B \u2264 300, each describing a single bubble. A bubble is described by three integers S, E, L where S is the meter of the track where the bubble first appeared and E is the meter of the track when the bubble disappeared. This means that paint is not applied from meter S through to, and including, meter E. This bubble appears on paint line L. Here, 1 \u2264 S \u2264 E \u2264 500 and 0 \u2264 L \u2264 9.\n\n\nFor example, if a bubble starts at meter 12 and ends at meter 15 on paint line 3, then there is no paint appearing on line number 3 over meters 12, 13, 14, and 15. In total, 4 meters of the line are not painted due to this particular bubble.\n\n\nSay the lanes are numbered from 1 to 9. Then lane 1 is delimited by lines 0 and 1, lane 2 by lines 1 and 2, lane 3 by lines 2 and 3, and so on. Also, the input will be such that no two bubbles in the same paint line share a common meter of the track. That is, if S,E and S',E' are the start and endpoints of two different bubbles on a common line L, then either E < S' or E' < S.\n\n\nOutput\n\nThe output for each test case consists of a single integer on a single line. This integer is the number of meters (out of 500) are such that every one of the 9 lanes on the track has at least one of the lines delimiting that lane fully painted throughout that meter.\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n3\n2\n1 3 1\n2 5 2\n2\n1 3 1\n2 5 3\n5\n60 60 4\n60 61 5\n61 61 6\n100 100 8\n100 100 9\n\nOutput:\n498\n500\n497\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

A discussion of possible approaches to solving this problem can be found in our blog.\nOne evening Johnny found some funny looking beens in his grandfather's garden shed, and decided to plant one of them. Next morning, to his surprise he found an enormous beanstalk growing in his back yard. Undaunted by its size, he decided to count its leaves.\n\nYou must know that beanstalks in Byteland grow in a very special way. At the lowest (1st) level, there is exactly one stem. At any level(including the 1st), a stem can end (forming exactly one leaf), or branch into exactly two stems which grow into the next level, following the same rules.\n\nJohnny believes he has managed to count the number of leaves at each of the levels of the beanstalk. However, you must know that before he began to count, Johnny ate one or two of the other beans he found in his grandfather's shed, and that's why he is not quite sure of his results. Please verify whether Johnny's results may possibly be correct, at least in theory.\n\n\n\nInput\nThe input starts with a line containing integer t, the number of test cases (1 \u2264 t \u2264 20). The descriptions of exactly t test cases follow.\nEach test case starts with an integer k, representing the number of levels of the beanstalk (1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^6). The next k non-negative space-separated integers (not greater than 10^6) represent the number of leaves of the beanstalk at successive levels, starting from level 1.\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, output a line containing exactly one of the words 'Yes' or 'No', depending on whether a beanstalk having the stated leaf counts can grow in accordance with the Bytelandian rules.\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n2\n3\n0 1 2\n3\n0 0 3\n\nOutput:\nYes\nNo\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

All the students with score strictly greater than at least (N-K) students' total score gets enrolled.\nIn total there are E entrance exams, in each of them one can score between 0 and M points, inclusively. The first E-1 exams had already been conducted, and now it's time for the last tribulation.\nSergey is the student who wants very hard to enter the university, so he had collected the information about the first E-1 from all N-1 enrollees (i.e., everyone except him). Of course, he knows his own scores as well.\nIn order to estimate his chances to enter the University after the last exam, Sergey went to a fortune teller. From the visit, he learnt about scores that everyone except him will get at the last exam. Now he wants to calculate the minimum score he needs to score in order to enter to the university. But now he's still very busy with minimizing the amount of change he gets in the shops, so he asks you to help him.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases.

Click here to read it. \nThe following problem appeared in the CodeChef March '09 Challenge\nIn the mysterious country of Byteland, everything is quite different from what you'd \n\nnormally expect. In most places, if you were approached by two mobsters in a dark alley, they would \n\nprobably tell you to give them all the money that you have. If you refused, or didn't have any - \n\nthey might even beat you up.\n\nIn Byteland the government decided that even the slightest chance of someone getting injured has to be ruled out. So, they introduced a strict policy. When a mobster approaches you in a dark \n\nalley, he asks you for a specific amount of money. You are obliged to show him all the money that \n\nyou have, but you only need to pay up if he can find a subset of your banknotes whose total value \n\nmatches his demand. Since banknotes in Byteland can have any positive integer value smaller than \n\none thousand you are quite likely to get off without paying.\n\nBoth the citizens and the gangsters of Byteland have very positive feelings about the system. No one ever \n\ngets hurt, the gangsters don't lose their jobs, and there are quite a few rules that minimize that \nprobability of getting mugged (the first one is: don't go into dark alleys - and this one is said to work in other places also).\n\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains integer t, the number of test cases (about 100). Then t test cases follow. Each test case starts with n, the \n\nnumber of banknotes in your wallet, and m, the amount of money the muggers asked of you. Then n \n\nnumbers follow, representing values of your banknotes. Your wallet does not hold more than 20 banknotes, and the value of a single banknote is never more than 1000.\n\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case output a single line with the word 'Yes' if there is a subset of your banknotes that sums  to m, and 'No' otherwise.\n\n\nExample\n\nInput:\n5\n3 3\n1\n1\n1\n5 11\n1\n2\n4\n8\n16\n5 23\n1\n2\n4\n8\n16\n5 13\n1\n5\n5\n10\n10\n20 132\n17\n6\n4\n998\n254\n137\n259\n153\n154\n3\n28\n19\n123\n542\n857\n23\n687\n35\n99\n999\n\nOutput:\nYes\nYes\nYes\nNo\nYes\n\n\nExplanation: For example, in the last case you have to pay up, since: 6+3+123=132.\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

While:\n >> \n ><>< \nare not.\nGiven some expressions which represent some instructions to be analyzed by Lira's compiler, you should tell the length of the longest prefix of each of these expressions that is valid, or 0 if there's no such a prefix.\n\nInput\nInput will consist of an integer T denoting the number of test cases to follow.\nThen, T strings follow, each on a single line, representing a possible expression in L++.\n\nOutput\nFor each expression you should output the length of the longest prefix that is valid or 0 if there's no such a prefix. \n\nConstraints\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 500\n1 \u2264 The length of a single expression \u2264 10^6\nThe total size all the input expressions is no more than 5*10^6\n\u00a0\n\nExample\nInput:\n3\n<<>>\n><\n<>>>\nOutput:\n4\n0\n2\n\n### Signature\ndef solve_problem(input_str: str) -> str:",

He knows that for every coin he can get very tasty bone from his master. He believes that some day he will find a treasure and have loads of bones.\nAnd finally he found something interesting. A wooden chest containing N coins! But as you should remember, Tuzik is just a little dog, and so he can't open it by himself. Actually, the only thing he can really do is barking. He can use his barking to attract nearby people and seek their help. He can set the loudness of his barking very precisely, and therefore you can assume that he can choose to call any number of people, from a minimum of 1, to a maximum of K.\nWhen people come and open the chest they divide all the coins between them in such a way that everyone will get the same amount of coins and this amount is maximal possible. If some coins are not used they will leave it on the ground and Tuzik will take them after they go away. Since Tuzik is clearly not a fool, he understands that his profit depends on the number of people he will call. While Tuzik works on his barking, you have to find the maximum possible number of coins he can get.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each of next T lines contains 2 space-separated integers: N and K, for this test case.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case output one integer - the maximum possible number of coins Tuzik can get.\n\nConstraints\n\n1 \u2264 T \u2264 50\n1 \u2264 N, K \u2264 10^5\n\n\nExample\nInput:\n2\n5 2\n11 3\n\nOutput:\n1\n2\n\nExplanation\nIn the first example he should call two people.
